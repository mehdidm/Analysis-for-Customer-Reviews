1,0528881469,"[12, 15]",1.0,"I'm a professional OTR truck driver, and I bought a TND 700 at a truck stop hoping to make my life easier.  Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6""), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted ""No Trucks"" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.

2,0528881469,"[43, 45]",3.0,"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.",2010-09-09,A3N7T0DY83Y4IG,C.

3,0528881469,"[9, 10]",2.0,"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6"" bridges when I'm 13'6"". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.",2010-11-24,A1H8PY3QHMQQA0,"Dave M.

39,0972683275,"[0, 0]",4.0,"I used it to mount a 32"" LCD TV to the wall... about 28LBS.  I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit ""off level"" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.",2011-05-31,A2KQDWZZUBBNOJ,Bradley Pool,It works!,1306800000.0,0.0,2011,5,2199.0,9,used mount lcd tv wall lb installed less hour happy result pro come hardware need come extra hardware idea suspect universal hardware pack several model hardware used model nice little extra always better enough included level nice well cheap work instruction decent enough job explaining install unit con metal tad flimsy side problem trusting lt lb television mount something closer maximum rated weight lb think would quite bit nervous holding hole base little bit wide wall stud think particular stud installing onto typical x centered left right side hole little far grab side stud reposition center hole aligned left side stud right side hole aligned right side stud result able install four six bolt hold place feel issue lb television house us wider stud probably even issue metal sag little bit weight television mounted base little bit level help compensate problem getting television level using adjustment available conclusion bad unit especially price yes would liked see sturdier unit take account lt price tag excellent bargain think issue static mounting tv corner bedroom considering installing unit television see lot traffic constant repositioning etc might want spend money something sturdier,work

The ability to move her 26"" TV around so she can play in other areas of the room is a welcomed addition.I subtracted 1 star because of the tacky instructions and poor cable management for something that moves at maximum, about 2 feet away from the wall.1 more star fell off because now that the TV is mounted, the mount seems to sag, even though there are two huge lag bolts in a stud mounting it. That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to ""fall"" in that direction on its hinges.

127,0972683275,"[2, 2]",4.0,"Warning, Do your homework before ordering a tv wall mount!!Mom and dad bought a 32 inch Seiki TV and needed it angled on the wall for optimum viewing. That is where I the eldest son came into the picture(pun intended).I knew in advance the location had plywood backing behind the drywall, which meant this mount would be easy to install as wood screws would be secure anywhere on the wall. But what if it was a typical installation, would there be a stud in the wall centered where needed to hold the tv and mount securely? It seems unlikely most people would, so what are the options?Option #1. Buy a different mount with a mounting plate rather than small 2 hole bracket as on this model. If you don't know what I am talking about, look at other tv wall mounts and you will see on many of these a large wall plate that can easily cover an area with at least one stud, and addtionally allow drywall anchors elsewhere on the plate to handle the weight of any tv. This model has only a small wall bracket with holes for 2 screws or anchors.Option #2. Use wall anchors. Again, there are only 2 holes in this bracket so take into account the weight of the tv and the rating of the anchors. Proceed at your own risk.Option #3. Install a stud. You're on your own with this...The mount is well made, everything fits and it looks good but as mentioned, a little homework will save you time and make installation easy.I hope this review is useful. :-)",2013-03-15,A120ULF73SUTI9,"J.

The problem is installation.  Maybe it's my own fault for thinking all TV wall mounts worked like the Peerless I had.  See, that one has a separate TV plate that you screw to the TV first.  Then you have the second piece (the actual wall mount) that you screw to the wall.  Once that's done, using the bracket mounted on the TV, you hang the TV on the wall mount and secure it with a single bolt.  One person can easily put a TV on the wall.Not so much with this one.  Yes, I will admit that once it's mounted, it's a more secure connection, but it's the mounting that's the problem.  You can't do it alone.  Depending on the weight of the TV, you will need at least one helper.  This mount is one piece, which means that you have to hold the TV to the wall-mounted plate while attaching it with screws.  That can get tricky, especially with heavier TVs (I used it for a while with my old LCD TV which weighs 40+ pounds).

So, for this VideSecu mount, inspite of poor installation instructions, I carfeully measured all domensions to fit my new 32"" Samsung LED SmartTV in a limited kitchen space. My mistake was, based on the diagrams, I assumed that the length of both the swinging arms of the mount (the single and the double arms) were of the same length. What a disaster! After installing the mount when I mounted the TV and folded the arms the TV did not center itself to the wall side of the mount! It was then that I noticed the inner length of the 2 arms is about 4"" longer than the outer single arm. In other words once the arms on the mount were fully folded in towards the wall my TV was not centered in the limited space that I had and looked awful.

203,0972683275,"[1, 1]",5.0,"This was needed to mount a 32"" LCD that weighs 27 lbs in my bedroom. I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall.

217,0972683275,"[0, 0]",5.0,"I originally bought this for a Sony 40&#34; TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42&#34; instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).

Unfortunately, the arm was welded to the wall bracket at a slight angle, meaning that regardless of how it would mount it and the LCD would never be level.Also, the powder coating near one of the bolts had come off and I could see some rust already forming.I decided to see if the mount would be the right fit for the tv before returning, figuring I would just get a replacement and hope for the best. I'm glad I did because this led me to find two other issues.The first one I blame on the manufacturers, the second I would consider a design flaw of the LG lcd.The first issue is that the screws supplied to attach the bracket to the tv are too few and two short. The screws are only 12mm long, and would barely catch in the threads of the TV if they weren't recessed at all. Most mounting threads on lcds and plasmas are partially recessed. I stopped by my local Lowes and picked up two packs of similar screws (M4-70 or something to that affect). $0.80 a packet so not much of an expenditure, just a big hassle. I needed 20mm long screws to mount this to the tv, so a pretty fair difference over what was supplied. The manufacturer supplies several different thread and gauge options, but only one shallow length of each set.The second issue is that this universal mount covered the power and HDMI ports on the back of the 26le5300. Again, I think this is more of an issue with the tv then the mount, as they're situated rather high and central. Either way, it's something you'll want to check on your tv before ordering this product.I actually returned this and in its stead purchased a similar mount from the same company. TheVideoSecu Swing LCD Wall Mount 20 inch Extension 55 lb loading capacity for LCD TV Monitor Flat Screen VESA 75mm/100 mm 1USgets very high marks from me.

237,1400501466,"[3, 4]",5.0,"The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.  Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a ""Brand X"" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as ""Automobile"" or ""National Geographic"".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines ""pop"" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special ""text only"" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook ""shop"" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get ""right"", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the ""book world"" and the ""video world"". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a ""book of the day"" for adults and a ""book of the day"" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was ""Mary Poppins"", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out.

243,1400501466,"[11, 11]",5.0,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more ""manly"" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera.

244,1400501466,"[0, 0]",3.0,"When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap.

248,1400501466,"[17, 19]",5.0,"Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for ""My Stuff"" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, ""Wow! it's as good as the Sony!""  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not ""locations"" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.

I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing.

251,1400501466,"[5, 5]",2.0,"I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual ""we got your request and will reply as soon as possible"" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally ""side loaded"" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to ""root"" products like these (especially since they aren't ""mine,"" as I won't be the one using them).  As the ""guy,"" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big ""n"" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the ""tablet"" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the ""expert"" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.",2012-01-04,A6VFSC0BW75Y0,Frederick J.

252,1400501466,"[6, 6]",4.0,"I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either. That being said, this also means that apps available from BN will actually work with your Nook, there isnt a quantity over quality in the app store either. This means that if you've bought an app from Android market, you will have to buy it again if you want to use it on the Nook.The screen. trust me, I love it. But unlike other tablets where if you crack the glass you just have to replace the glass, on the Nook if you crack it, the screen is toastno front facing camera (or any camera for that matter). The ability to use Skype would have been nice, but wasn't a complete necessity. I've had many friends with tablets that had a camera that swear they never used it even once, and thinking about it, I wuld seldom use it either since most places outsite of my house that I will use it are places where video chatting would be frowned on, like Starbucks or the libraryno bluetooth, which to me didn't matter, but it seems to be an issue for some people. There IS bluetooth, but it's disabled and there isn't a way to enable itno GPS, this would be nice, unlike bluetooth, I would actually use it.mono speaker instead of stereo, again seems to be an issue for other people, I plug it into the minijack on my surround sound at home or the jack in my car stereo when I'm on the road though and its just fine. I use headphones if I'm out and about. Why on earth would I care about speakers that I never use anyway?no .flac support. a good chunk of my digital music now is .flac. it does have .ogg support thoughno .avi support. again, a massive portion of my movies etc are all in .avi format. It does have .mkv and .mp4 support though, so from here on out I will just have to rip my video files in those formats if I plan on watching them on it.lack of decent accessories selection. lets face it, the case market seems to be geared toward people that worship at the church of Steve, and the availability of accessories shows it.",2012-02-27,AQNEQQ96MKX3Y,"Gojira Neko (godzilla cat) ""widowpress""",GREAT .cbz (comic file) reader an more!,1330300800.0,1.0,2012,2,4261.0,39,went place try testing best place test first hand bn people walmart want near know anything best buy pretty much except could sorta test bn though people trained know everything even stuff listed bn website first thing listed nook colour nook tablet instance read cbz file without installing extra apps gb model much responsive gb well worth extra buck add currently buy one bn like week return full refund long still new condition attempting root device rep told brick unlike colour pretty much sold found place micro sd card sale bought took nook home pro screen awesome use reading cbz comic pdf file anything missing gap glass screen made reading much better also response touch screen great much better response time turning page launching apps using inet tablet budget rangenative flash supportnative cbz support main reason bought support almost every popular ebook format except mobi converted epub pdf anyway good size holding one handed reading lightweight pound battery life hour wifi tried watched lot movie reading without coming close dying test drive opportunity buy bn dont scratch anything like idea able take home actually everything want wihtout fear stuck good also buy bn buy oops return warranty mean spill coffee drop replaced affordable go without thing like eating x week awhilecons lack android market lack apps would like see bn market google music app sideloading apps moment either said also mean apps available bn actually work nook isnt quantity quality app store either mean bought app android market buy want use nook screen trust love unlike tablet crack glass replace glass nook crack screen toastno front facing camera camera matter ability use skype would nice complete necessity many friend tablet camera swear never used even thinking wuld seldom use either since place outsite house use place video chatting would frowned like starbucks libraryno bluetooth matter seems issue people bluetooth disabled way enable itno gps would nice unlike bluetooth would actually use mono speaker instead stereo seems issue people plug minijack surround sound home jack car stereo road though fine use headphone earth would care speaker never use anyway flac support good chunk digital music flac ogg support thoughno avi support massive portion movie etc avi format mkv mp support though rip video file format plan watching lack decent accessory selection let face case market seems geared toward people worship church steve availability accessory show,great cbz comic file reader

269,1400501466,"[1, 1]",5.0,"Just picked up a refurbished Nook Tablet from newegg's website and its amazing. Only has a 1024 x 600 pixel screen but from a foot away you can't tell the different between this and a device with 1200 x 800 pixels or more. Reading is a pleasure. I've had all the Kindles and all the Nooks and for the best overall reading experience the Nook is better.Why? The Nook devices feel great to hold. The plastics are soft, all the buttons are in good places, and recharging takes no time at all. Also, the software layout and navigation is easy and logical. Next, the font choices, sizes, and other personalizations are all useful. And finally, no freaking ads. You can personalize your home screen and on the Nook Touch you can select your own photos for the screen saver.What's my problem then with Kindle? Couple things. The ads of course. Also, I personally don't care for the software. You are stuck in their software with no way to personalize it. Boring! Also, the buttons are in bad places so you can accidentally shut the device off. On the lower priced Kindles the font choices are fewer and the smaller size choices are useless unless you use a magnifying glass. And the devices aren't as nice to hold. At least on the Fires they took the idea from Nook on making the backs have a soft plastic.I'm pretty sure that anyone who takes the time to try both Nook and Kindle will like the Nook better. As reading devices go they just make more sense. As far as a full fledged tablet goes you'll have to look to Apple or Samsung in my opinion.

273,1400501466,"[52, 57]",1.0,"Update 2-Sep-13:Put on CM 10.2.2 (Android 4.2.2) last week.  I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7"" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like ""&lt;"", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7"" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.",2012-01-02,A2ILMCJBXWF5TS,"Steve ""Steve (Walnut Creek, CA, USA)""",Very Limited Unless

When I read all the wonderful reviews about the Nook HD+ I couldn't wait to buy one.  The main reason that I bought the reader is that my vision has deteriorated over the years to where I need at least 16 point type.  The availability of different sized type on the reader devices is very welcome.  I use the tablet, not only for reading, but to watch Netflix movies while on my exercise bike.  The Nook tablet works okay for that, but the larger display of the HD+ seemed that it would be an improvement.  However, there are several problems with the current edition:There needed to be at least one more font size at the high-end.  I had to choose between too small and too large.The sound level was too low, even with headphones.  I could not find a Barnes and Noble application to provide better control over the volume.  There are a number of third-party applications which used to work on the Nook tablet that are now locked out by the current OS version.So, in spite of the beautiful display, I reluctantly returned the HD+ to my local store.

I purchased mine direct from B&N. This is a fantastic ereader with a few tablet functions. I really like the interface on this ereader more so than the Kindle Fire. Don't get me wrong, the Kindle Fire is a very nice device, but I like the personal touch I can give the Nook HD. It's more customizable.I can create my own wallpaper and customize my home screen. The ereader is very light and easy to hold with a contoured, grippy back. The screen resolution is fantastic! Even small print is readable. The colors in magazines is exceptional and the scrapbook feature is an innovative touch. I really appreciate having a physical home button, and external volume rockers & power button. The interface is very user friendly and aesthetically pleasing. Setting up email was a snap and customizing my security settings from lock screen passwords to shopping passwords is much appreciated. Web browsing is very zippy on this device. More zippy than the Kindle Fire. Ereading is also a pleasure, with customizable fonts & backgrounds. I was surprised at how well I was able to read on it outside in the shade. It still has a lot of glare, but it is much more readable than the Ipad or the Kindle Fire.I can't see the Ipad or Kindle Fire screen at all outside with all the glare. Nook HD is NOT as readable as an eink screen, so I will be keeping my original Nook of 3 years for outdoor reading. But for a tablet ereader, I was really surprised at how well it did outside in the shade. I have since given my husband the Ipad 2, as I like the 7"" form factor of the ereader/tablet devices.

Magazines on this screen are amazing, I especially like reading Time because of the outstanding photography they do. Books look great, and the selection of games on the Barnes and Noble store is alright. A little annoying paying again for games I already bought on my phone, but that's not so bad.Further, you really don't need to pay again for games if you install a custom ROM on an SD card. You can either purchase one premade (google for N2A for more info) or you can burn your own if you google a little more and spend the afternoon trying different things. It's not scary at all, especially since you're only doing stuff on the SD card not the tablet itself. If you want to undo it, just take the card out! Anyway, the custom ROM just gets you stock android, and that opens this great device up to the full android market of games and apps. You can still read all your Barnes and Noble stuff on the B&N; android app. I read my Wired subscription that way, as well as some books. Anyway, I think this device and the ROM on the SD card is the best of B&N; and android.Anyway, I'd compare this with the Google Nexus 7. The nook has a slightly higher resolution screen, which is kinda neat especially for magazines. No front facing camera on the nook, but my phone already is great for video chat so I don't miss it. Also, the custom ROM I put on my SD card is android 4.2, whereas google says the Nexus is android 4.1...maybe they'll get an update soon I don't know. So, either way, you probably can't lose.EDIT: Barnes and Noble opened up the stock software to be able to use almost all of the apps in the google play store.

The instruction set is barely nuts and bolts but it gives one the essentials.It passed the back pocket test famously. This was done straightaway. Was very pleased with this feature.But buyer beware. I discovered this Nook tablet has no camera at all. Who ever heard of such a thing? There is a reasonable expectation.The Nook downloaded and upgraded itself famously. Everything was smooth and cheerful.The speed of the Nook was very good in my opinion. Page to page was smooth and cheerful and moderately fast. The book pages are easy to read. Another Dan Brown book (I think). Made the discovery with Inferno. Played/watched Linux Action Show and other video for about 3 hours with about 15% of the battery power left.Checked YouTube and Amazon to see the how the graphic's engine worked in the Nook. The motion pictures were crisp and clear on YouTube and Amazon. The sound was very excellent and voluminous much to my surprise. Can hear the device clearly and with ease even though I am kinda hard of hearing. The movie scenes moved like a big computer rendering of the graphics. The motion pictures were like a TV broadcast. Not kidding.Now the ultimate bummer: their much touted microSDHC card can not play your own content downloaded from a computer. Later, several hours later there was an additional patch of 75 upgrades that made the microSDHC capable of playing video files/movies. The selection it can play is very limited compared to other more recent operating systems in Android devices. The latest Android operating system is 4.4 KitKat. The Nook will not play certain AVI or HD files. It is very persnickety  What the Nook can play is rendered exceptionally well indeed. It can only play things downloaded from Nooks libraries for sale-wrong as mentioned. I would have never bought this dohickey if I knew thee was no camera natively in advance.One always takes for granted a camera. And their microSDHC is nothing short of a rip-off. Jeez- wrong now.My Chinese Brand X tablets can play my media content in AVI. MP3/4 and other popular media formats very well indeed. These Brand X tablets can play far more movie/video files than the Nook. Their Android versions are newer than the Nook's.The back pocket thing was a real plus. Great sound. Great graphics. Good speed.But these pluses can not counter balance the negatives. The camera is not as important as real robust motion graphics and awesome sound to me. Now I am thinking I will keep this Nook because it does have a viable if not bugged up microSDHC card port capable of music and motion picture replay. Forget file sharing in Android.B&N; needs a No Brainer award for greed and stupidity just like Apple, Kindle and Nexus. Apple, Kindle and Nexus deserve the No-Brainer award more because the Nook's microSDHC does work but has limited compatibility with the files/apps that can play these type of music and movie files.Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this thingamajig.

I added a 16gb sd card filled with thousands of my favorite songs. But, the Nook is designed to be an ereader...it is not a games tablet, or an IPad.I got my Nook Tablet (8gb version) from Barnes & Noble because of the extra discount I got with my B&N; membership...the price was MUCH less than advertised by most internet venders. I already have a Brand X color e-reader and a Nook Simple Touch reader. My old color reader was hard on my eyes for long reading sessions, the Nook Touch is great for books, but it does not have internet access or play music and magazines don't really work without a color screen.The Nook tablet has very sharp, clear, and contrasty fonts and is very pleasant to read, even for several hours. There is a night mode, and also a sephia mode for reading in bed without bothering anyone else. Magazines look great on its color screen. I listen to music on Pandora while I read, and when I am tired of reading, I can watch a movie on Netflix or a tv show on TV.com. I installed the Dolphin browser which uses tabs so I can switch quickly among various web pages.Vevo music videos look great, but the Nook's speaker is too weak to enjoy music. However, music sounds great through good ear buds and when I plug the Nook into my computer speakers.The Nook is an e-reader, NOT an I-Pad or high powered tablet. It does not have access to Google Play to obtain apps, so you are limited to the apps in the Nook app store. Those apps have been developed just for the Nook and its seven inch screen. The apps in Google Play are mostly designed for the smaller screens of cell phones, while Nook apps are designed just for the Nook.Bottom line: the Nook Tablet 8gb is a terrific way to read books and magazines while enjoying your favorite music (I loaded a 16gb memory card with thousands of my favorite songs...transferring the songs over to the Nook from my laptop was fast and easy).For folks who want the ""full"" tablet experience, Amazon.com sells the N2A card which enables you to boot your Nook into a full tablet mode, with access to Google Play, and the 400,000 apps available there.

The software and usability is noticeably different though, and that's where you should pay close attention.  I bought my wife the Nook Tablet for Christmas and she uses it a fair amount.  I haven't heard any major complaints from her but here are the ones I've heard most often.The Barnes and Noble App Store is a joke.  I looked through it for about 5 minutes and barely ever saw a free app.  Many popular apps and games are there, but usually you can only get the paid version.  Adding insult to injury, side-loading is difficult if not impossible without rooting the device (this will void the warranty).  I didn't expect side-loading to be a given really, but if you block those apps you really need a decent App Store to make up for it.The SD card slot, which many people may not ever use, is in a pretty odd spot.  It's not really hard to pry back the cover but since you're working with a micro-SD card it can be really annoying to  line up such a tiny card in the slot.  If that wasn't annoying, it is definitely annoying to load your PDFs or whatever from the SD card once its inserted.  For someone who isn't really tech-savvy it isn't obvious how to read those files.  The reader app could really do a better job of detecting documents when the SD card is inserted.On the aesthetic side the launcher could use some work.  Although I think the scrolling app dock at the bottom is slightly more elegant than a grid-like app drawer, there's little organization to the home screen.  You can drag icons around, to and from the dock, but apps/books don't lock to any kind of grid on the home screen.  Some of us who are more anal retentive just won't stand for two icons being less than parallel.  You can see a better view of your media by opening the Library app, which is a nice app, but I find the contrast displeasing, further emphasizing this is a tablet with e-reader functions (or vice versa maybe).  Basically the cohesion isn't there and you start to wonder, with all of the restrictions, why you didn't just get a regular tablet.I still haven't rooted my wife's tablet but maybe if something annoys her enough she'll let me do it.  Otherwise, if you're not planning to root the NOOK, beware of its restrictions and browse its App Store for a bit to see if the selection and prices are a deal-breaker.

306,1400501776,"[2, 3]",3.0,"(update) I find my review written about Nook HD included here for an entirely different model tablet. Amazon or B*N this is unethical!D.F.---------------Nook HD overviewGreat screen, no cameras, weak speakers, crappy battery life, compromised android OS, but an inexpensive way to browse web and run the world of android apps on a fast, beautiful display. Plus it has a microSD slot to hold lots of videos for offline viewing. And of course, its original purpose, to provide a slick interface for purchase and reading of magazines and books.PlusesWide range of browers available. I have 9 on my machine. All browsers for tablets have reduced functionality so some browsers are better than others for specific tasks. For example, Firefox will play video in HD and does not redirect to mobile sites. Tint and Zirco have a homepage that will access a local html file. With several browsers installed it's easier to get around site restrictions. Firefox has an addon that auto-deletes cookies. Chrome allows spoken search inputs.The world of 700,000 android apps can now be accessed on Nook HD including big and nice apps: Google earth, Skype, YouTube in HD, Adobe Reader, WiFi Analyzer, WiFi Fixer (essential Wifi tool), Google maps, best solitaire ever (by MobilityWare), and free 'run' games. Custom moving backgrounds on Nook HD home screens are fun.AnnoyancesIn two months I have not figured out how to add a browser link to Nook HD home page. Some browsers have the option to add a link to the homepage, but it never works! (It must be that the Nook HD OS does not allow this)Poor battery life, by test I get only 4 hours.Adroid apps normally just suspend, so it tends to take too many presses and taps to cleanly start an application.Audio does not shut off when you exit most radio and music apps. With no OS support for shutting apps down I often have to resort to a reset to silence them.Built-in email has a short time window so you only see few or no messages. Apps like FastHotMail can provide workaround.Screen capture is clumsy (pushing Home and Vol- requires a lot of force and nearly simultaneous pushes).Nook HD not really useful for music, sans headphones, because sound volume on speakers is relatively low.Setting up icons on home screens is kind of a pain. Half of the main screen is taken up by a carousel that cannot be removed. The Nook recommended way of moving an icon to an adjacent screen is to hold icon overlapping the edge, but I find this hit or miss, it only seems reliable after a reset.File directories can be accessed via USB, but have some annoyances: Many file managers have a hard time finding personal files lost in a maze of OS directories. Nook HD allows deletion of its standard user directories (like 'kids B&N; files') only to later write them back again.Tablet does not reliably remember some settings. Occasionally I find the screen will be dim or the notification is too loud and when I look the setting has changed.No way (that I have found) to add personal data for quick entry.(update)Bluetooth keyboard problem solvedI have an inexpensive bluetooth keyboard that works fine with another tablet (Blackberry Playbook), but I could not get it to work with Nook HD. It would pair fine, but nothing happened when keys are hit. I see others complaining of this too. Finally I solved the problem with an app called BlueInput (available on Play Store). It now does the pairing, not Nook OS, and you select the bluetooth keyboard using 'Switch Keyboard' icon.(update)Fix for adding web link icons to the home page.

326,1400532620,"[7, 8]",3.0,"I purchased both the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and this Nook (the original) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (better screen contrast, and many other features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch (Nook ST) ereader. It is just now starting to show up in B&N; stores (not on Amazon yet). I was lucky enough to find a store near me that had one that was not spoken for yet. I bought it yesterday and have been busy trying it out. It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook ST, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone.  The touchscreen on the Nook ST is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine.  I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.I returned the original Nook since the Nook ST is so much better. Note that the Nook ST doesn't have 3G connectivity, a web browser, or an MP3 player. If you want all that, buy the original Nook. If you don't require all of these features and would like a basic e-reader with an intuitive touch screen interface, then take a look at the Nook ST.The Nook ST is just beginning to become available (only at B&N; right now), but I suspect that Amazon and other high quality retailers will be selling it very soon.Here's another plus for the Nook (whether it is the original one or the ST).  The Kindle has a proprietary ebook format that limits your options in purchasing and reading ebooks.  Nook uses Adobe EPUB, which is an open format and there are multiple online sites that offer books in this format (including most public libraries).",2011-06-05,A39K7R4Y1ZD5SZ,cacalazani,"This Nook is Good, but the new Nook Simple Touch is WAY Better",1307232000.0,0.875,2011,6,2995.0,62,purchased kindle wi fi nook original tried return period thing kindle really liked better screen contrast many feature reviewer kindle site written one thing made choose nook ability borrow read ebooks local library back library since come nook simple touch nook st ereader starting show b n store amazon yet lucky enough find store near one spoken yet bought yesterday busy trying e ink pearl screen kindle screen contrast longer issue wow user interface improved original nook thought clunky entire e ink pearl screen full touchscreen capability kindle original nook felt wanting touch screen select book read instead using button kindle lcd touchscreen original nook highlight select desired ebook nook st library screen show icon ebooks loaded device library purchased touch icon ebook open turning page touch screen right side page go forward left side go back swipe finger across screen flipping physical book page use button built frame want page quickly book hold page turning button need word definition touch hold word dictionary pop user interface resembles iphone ipad icon virtual keyboard physical home button even slide unlock feature like iphone touchscreen nook st infrared sens heat finger like iphone light touch work fine found original nook sometimes would take multiple touch lcd screen device recognize command returned original nook since nook st much better note nook st g connectivity web browser mp player want buy original nook require feature would like basic e reader intuitive touch screen interface take look nook st nook st beginning become available b n right suspect amazon high quality retailer selling soon another plus nook whether original one st kindle proprietary ebook format limit option purchasing reading ebooks nook us adobe epub open format multiple online site offer book format including public library,nook good new nook simple touch way better
327,1400532620,"[4, 4]",5.0,"I was the biggest nook/kindle hater on the planet before being gifted this nook. I would constantly diss the e-readers claiming that books were soooo much better. Then I ordered a book series from Amazon and the books/print was so tiny that I could barely read them without straining my eyes and driving myself crazy. My mom (&lt;3!!) gave me my brothers old nook since he had a new nook color so I could download and read the series on this. It wasn't cheap to download the books, but compared to reading the free versions a friend had sent me (which were horrible because the text was all messed up...typos galore) but the option to make the text larger or smaller and the clarity of the screen made the 8+ dollars per book soooo worth the price.The battery on this lasts so long it's insane. I would read daily maybe 5 hours per day over the summer (hey, I had to finish the series before school resumed!) and I only had to charge it once a week tops, even then the battery wasn't drained I just didn't want to give it a chance to run out. I am so in love with my nook now it's insane. I can download almost any book I could possibly need and carry it around in this tiny little, lightweight nook.Another big plus....MY BOOKMARKS DON'T FALL OUT OF THE NOOK!! Nothing is more frustrating than losing your place and going bananas trying to find it without revealing something you haven't read yet.Also, when it comes to textbooks this is a lifesaver!! My back loves the nook. I cannot recommend the nook (or any e-reader in general) enough. You can still buy physical books (I do and will never stop because I absolutely love them) but for an avid reader the nook is such a great addition to your life.Even though my first nook was free (making it that much sweeter), I would gladly lay down $100+ for a replacement if anything happened to mine or for a newer model, not the color though, that's more like a tablet PC than an e-reader.",2011-10-02,A84O215CIZY6W,Chantellicus Optimus,From hater to smitten with this amazing little device...,1317513600.0,1.0,2011,10,1936.0,56,biggest nook kindle hater planet gifted nook would constantly dis e reader claiming book soooo much better ordered book series amazon book print tiny could barely read without straining eye driving crazy mom lt gave brother old nook since new nook color could download read series cheap download book compared reading free version friend sent horrible text messed typo galore option make text larger smaller clarity screen made dollar per book soooo worth price battery last long insane would read daily maybe hour per day summer hey finish series school resumed charge week top even battery drained want give chance run love nook insane download almost book could possibly need carry around tiny little lightweight nook another big plus bookmark fall nook nothing frustrating losing place going banana trying find without revealing something read yet also come textbook lifesaver back love nook recommend nook e reader general enough still buy physical book never stop absolutely love avid reader nook great addition life even though first nook free making much sweeter would gladly lay replacement anything happened mine newer model color though like tablet pc e reader,hater smitten amazing little device
328,1400532620,"[4, 4]",5.0,"I asked for this e-reader for Christmas due to seeing it in a Barnes and Noble store and learning about its features. It  offers greater compatibility with different ebook formats than the Kindle (particularly the EPUB format), has access to special offers when you're inside a Barnes and Noble store, and permits you to lend books to other Nook users. There's also a little color LCD touch screen at the bottom for accessing menu options.Personally, I haven't taken advantage of most of the Nook's features yet, but I do like what I see so far. The touchscreen adds a great deal of versatility to the device and I'd say it's easier to access menu options this way than with just one e-ink screen and some buttons. I also appreciate the ability to upgrade the memory with a microSD card, but I would have preferred to do so without opening the device. Also, if you have a problem with the Nook, you shouldn't have a problem getting a replacement. I, er, damaged my first Nook through, shall we say, ""user error,"" but B&N; staff was happy to provide a new one for me.It's not quite perfect, though. It's kind of heavy, for one thing. The touchscreen is a bit slow to respond and can significantly drain the battery, for another. And, some of the Nook's buttons seem to be a little too stiff. I prefer soft, clicky buttons, you know? Maybe in its next iteration the Nook will have proper buttons instead of this ""bendy plastic"" business.Anyway, which e-reader you get largely boils down to your personal preferences, and which retailer's online library you'd rather have access to. For my part, I think the Nook satisfies all of my needs just fine. Be careful where you buy it from, though. $180, which is the price it's selling for on Amazon right now, is way too much when you can just walk into a brick and mortar store and get it for thirty bucks less.",2011-01-20,A1XY86U23W6LQ,"C.

329,1400532620,"[2, 7]",1.0,"I bought a nook about 8 months ago. I wanted to consider a Kindle but they were not available locally so I was very hesitant to buy one sight-unseen.BN had just released their wifi-only version for $149 which was very reasonable. I bought one from BN with moderate research and minimal hands-on. I have regretted it ever since.Today I said goodbye to my nook library and bought a kindle3. I can't comment on it very much except it is light-years faster than the nook and the interface actually works. I have about 90 books in my nook library, most of which I paid for so I'm a little frustrated.Things that are good about the nook:1. It looks much better than a kindle. While it sits there unused on my nightstand.2. ePub support. I live in Alaska which means it will be another 5 years before our libraries start loaning books via epub so it's not a big deal for me.3. Free Fridays. Every Friday nook owners can download a BN-selected book for free. Most are crappy fantasy/romance books but I have discovered several very good authors that I wouldn't have otherwise.Things that are bad about the nook:1. Awful, awful, awful touch input. I cringe thinking about using my nook with the unwieldy touchscreen. The screen itself is slow to respond, it sometimes registers additional clicks but mostly just ignores them while giving you visual feedback so you wait 5-10 seconds for it to actually do nothing.The touchscreen display is very jerky and difficult to navigate. You navigate the menus by scrolling through them on the touchpad. It will randomly jump to the top or the bottom. It will randomly ignore a touch (there is visual feedback, so it's not a mis-touch). It will randomly click twice on the succeeding menus.Trying to type on the keyboard or use it to look up a word (you need to use arrow keys on the touchpad to scroll a sluggish cursor around the page to pick one) is a test in patience I no longer have patience for. The keys provide visual feedback when pressed. This suggests you can type away merrily until you look at the text field to see only 2 or 3 characters were actually used. You have to type very sloooow and deliberate for the gnomes inside to catch up with you.The touchscreen is the main reason I ditched the nook. It is horribly implemented and makes the entire device borderline unusable.2. Browser. The BN rep sure talked that up. After spending 15 minutes trying to use the browser to register a BN account so I could actually read books I gave up and used my laptop. The browser takes about 30 seconds on average to display a page. It doesn't matter if it's a real page, the mobile version of Facebook or just google search. It will also randomly crash every minute or two. And by crash I mean you will suddenly be returned to the home screen for no apparent reason.Do not buy the nook if you even think you might want to try using it as a browser to check your email while you're sitting in bed reading a book.3. Battery life sucks. Sorry, but it does. I like to read a lot and having to charge it every couple days makes me upset they claim a 14-day battery life on it. I think it gets about 14 hours per charge (minus the 10% when it automatically goes to sleep). There is a persistent charging bug with the nook, or at least with mine; If you have wifi enabled but the device is sleeping (as in just normally leaving wifi on) when you plug it in to charge, the wifi will activate internally as it (I assume) checks with BN for book updates. This stops the charging and it will not resume unless you turn off the wifi and unplug and replug the charging cable.This is very frustrating as you plug the device in and forget to turn off the wifi. The next morning you grab it only to see the cute ""Your battery is too low to operate"" message.4. It weighs about 20% more than the kindle and is noticeably thicker. Not a big deal, but if you're in bed reading with one hand it weighs about as much as a heavier hardcover which means you're switching hands every so often. Heavier does not always mean better.5. Page turns. When I first got the nook it took between 3-5 seconds to turn a page. I would actually press the page turn button when I got to the last paragraph and could finish it before the page turned. A software update has vastly improved the page turn speed (about .5 seconds now) but only when turning the actual book pages. Library pages, shopping and browsing shelves still take 3+ seconds. I have tried a factory reset twice and either my device is defective (BN support did not think so) or it still sucks. This also strongly influences the cursor movement speed when trying to select a word and the speed at which you can enter text.6. Screen readability is acceptable. It looks like the page was printed on a crappy inkjet printer, with pixilation apparent. The kindle is more crisp and darker.7. The included Merrium Webster dictionary is broken. A large number of entries simply do not work. If you search for one of the effected entries the nook performs a search before inexplicably returning you to the book page. I do not remember which letter(s) are affected but it does not appear to be priority for BN to fix.8. Shelves. Shelves are BN's answer to everyone complaining how difficult it is to find books in the library. You can create a custom named shelf and place books on it. It is very clunky and sluggish and expect to spend 30 seconds trying to find your new book and another 15 trying to put it on a shelf. Sometimes it just won't let you put a book on a shelf and you have to restart the nook. This adds another 2 hours because you will be so frustrated by this point you will put the nook down start punching holes in the wall.9. Sometimes books fail to open. This means you have to go back to your library and open the book again. I have no idea why it happens but it happens frequently enough to mention. Once you get a book open and keep reading that book until you're finished it works well enough. But the menus, navigation and overall usefulness is virtually nonexistent.10. It's built on an android platform, which means it's buggy and randomly crashes or stops working. A restart usually solves this, but I keep shouting ""WHY, WHY, WHY"" every time I have to. Although I haven't had to restart it since I got the kindle. This may or may not be a result of not using it any more.Closing thoughts: I would encourage you very strongly to use one before buying it and investing in an e-library only to find yourself in the same situation I found myself. If you really have your heart set on it, buy from a local BN and try it out for a couple weeks so you can return it. I waited for the nook software update that was supposed to fix all these problems. After that seemingly only addressed the page turn speed I was outside of the return period and stuck with this nice-looking nightstand decorum.",2011-05-15,AJQRYTPV3JK3C,Dan O.,"Save your money, or 10 reasons the nook is awful",1305417600.0,0.2857142857142857,2011,5,6872.0,48,bought nook month ago wanted consider kindle available locally hesitant buy one sight unseen bn released wifi version reasonable bought one bn moderate research minimal hand regretted ever since today said goodbye nook library bought kindle comment much except light year faster nook interface actually work book nook library paid little frustrated thing good nook look much better kindle sits unused nightstand epub support live alaska mean another year library start loaning book via epub big deal free friday every friday nook owner download bn selected book free crappy fantasy romance book discovered several good author otherwise thing bad nook awful awful awful touch input cringe thinking using nook unwieldy touchscreen screen slow respond sometimes register additional click mostly ignores giving visual feedback wait second actually nothing touchscreen display jerky difficult navigate navigate menu scrolling touchpad randomly jump top bottom randomly ignore touch visual feedback mi touch randomly click twice succeeding menu trying type keyboard use look word need use arrow key touchpad scroll sluggish cursor around page pick one test patience longer patience key provide visual feedback pressed suggests type away merrily look text field see character actually used type sloooow deliberate gnome inside catch touchscreen main reason ditched nook horribly implemented make entire device borderline unusable browser bn rep sure talked spending minute trying use browser register bn account could actually read book gave used laptop browser take second average display page matter real page mobile version facebook google search also randomly crash every minute two crash mean suddenly returned home screen apparent reason buy nook even think might want try using browser check email sitting bed reading book battery life suck sorry like read lot charge every couple day make upset claim day battery life think get hour per charge minus automatically go sleep persistent charging bug nook least mine wifi enabled device sleeping normally leaving wifi plug charge wifi activate internally assume check bn book update stop charging resume unless turn wifi unplug replug charging cable frustrating plug device forget turn wifi next morning grab see cute battery low operate message weighs kindle noticeably thicker big deal bed reading one hand weighs much heavier hardcover mean switching hand every often heavier always mean better page turn first got nook took second turn page would actually press page turn button got last paragraph could finish page turned software update vastly improved page turn speed second turning actual book page library page shopping browsing shelf still take second tried factory reset twice either device defective bn support think still suck also strongly influence cursor movement speed trying select word speed enter text screen readability acceptable look like page printed crappy inkjet printer pixilation apparent kindle crisp darker included merrium webster dictionary broken large number entry simply work search one effected entry nook performs search inexplicably returning book page remember letter affected appear priority bn fix shelf shelf bn answer everyone complaining difficult find book library create custom named shelf place book clunky sluggish expect spend second trying find new book another trying put shelf sometimes let put book shelf restart nook add another hour frustrated point put nook start punching hole wall sometimes book fail open mean go back library open book idea happens happens frequently enough mention get book open keep reading book finished work well enough menu navigation overall usefulness virtually nonexistent built android platform mean buggy randomly crash stop working restart usually solves keep shouting every time although restart since got kindle may may result using closing thought would encourage strongly use one buying investing e library find situation found really heart set buy local bn try couple week return waited nook software update supposed fix problem seemingly addressed page turn speed outside return period stuck nice looking nightstand decorum,save money reason nook awful
330,1400532620,"[1, 1]",4.0,"When I purchased this item it was still running $150.  At the current price, I think it's a good deal but I'm not sure it would be my choice if I could roll back time.  I originally purchased this because I wanted to rent ebooks from the Library and that wasn't an option with the Kindle.  Now, they come for the Kindle as well as in epub and pdf formats.  You can basically use any ereader to rent these now.I read all these reviews saying that the black and white was like paper, easiest to read.  It's not anything like a paper book, it's far less ""bright"" when it comes to reading.  Don't get me wrong, I love ebooks.  I haven't read a paper book in a year.  It is just that even in regular light it is not as easy to see for me.  You absolutely can read it without a light during the day, but it is not nearly as crisp or easy as it would be with a paper book.  I have a clip on light, and with that it's perfect at night.  I'm able to read in bed and not disturb my husband, if one wants a black and white reader as close to paper as you can get--I'm just not sure this is what one would expect.This reader has a browser which you can use to get on the internet.  It was handy when we were in a hotel with wifi and I didn't bring the laptop and I needed to know when a business opened.  It's certainly not easy to surf, this would not be my choice to use unless in a pinch.The battery does not last as long as I expected.  I get maybe a week and a half out of it, if I turn it completely off when not using it--and if I have it on airplane mode (not wifi enabled).  I do read at least a few hours a day.  The time is much shorter if I let it just hibernate.I am not sure if the text size options are specific to the device or the book.  It appears to me it is the device that offers limited options, though it varies based on the originating text of the book. The text size on extra large--the largest option-- is often (it varies by book) small enough that it would equal that of a normal book.  My vision is pretty good and occasionally I'm annoyed by how small extra large is.  In some books medium is the same as extra large in others.  I do think that for anyone with vision challenges, limited text size might be an issue.Obtaining books is easy to do through Barnes and Noble.  You need to go online on a computer and provide a credit card.  You can then order them on the computer, or through your device.  I generally use the computer, but if you know what you want--ordering directly from the Nook is quick and easy.  Transferring library rentals is also as easy as drag and drop, using Adobe Digital Solutions (free app, the library should have a link to download it).All in all, it's a good ereader.

331,1400532620,"[6, 6]",5.0,"I have been eyeballing e-readers for a while and I was absolutely certain that I was going to purchase a Kindle.  Well many moons ago I worked at Barnes and Noble and stopped in to visit and old friend.  He introduced me to the Nook, I shrugged up my nose and said, 'Yeah, I'm sold on the Kindle.'After playing around with the Nook, I really found myself enamored of it.  I like the touch screen.  I like that the battery replacement if necessary is something the consumer can do.  I liked that you could share your nook books with others.  On the Nook that I have -and I did purchase a refurbished Nook - games included are suduko and chess.  The daily is a feature that automatically downloads articles specifically for the Nook users.  The library is where you can store all of your books and create shelves for your titles and organize the titles.  Shopping is a breeze, either directly on the nook or online.  You will need a card, be it debit or credit to purchase the books, you can use gift cards, but I believe that you need to have a card on file.I can store and listen to music on my Nook, I can access the internet (mine is WiFi) and use it to search and answer email or update facebook.In short, I'm madly in love with it.  I have not had any problems with it.

Archiving titles would allow you to free up space on your Nook.Recommendations, I have a silicone slip cover to protect my Nook if I drop it, I also have a slightly hardcover case to protect the Nook when it is in my purse, I do have a book light as the screens are not backlit to avoid glare.The only downside, some fools will think your screen is paper and they will touch it in awe and smudge up your reading screen.",2010-12-30,A89ZZKNDFQH23,Delaney,I really love this,1293667200.0,1.0,2010,12,2339.0,18,eyeballing e reader absolutely certain going purchase kindle well many moon ago worked barnes noble stopped visit old friend introduced nook shrugged nose said yeah sold kindle playing around nook really found enamored like touch screen like battery replacement necessary something consumer liked could share nook book others nook purchase refurbished nook game included suduko chess daily feature automatically downloads article specifically nook user library store book create shelf title organize title shopping breeze either directly nook online need card debit credit purchase book use gift card believe need card file store listen music nook access internet mine wifi use search answer email update facebook short madly love problem charge hold pretty long time measured time myslef simple use friendly incredible book selection nook happen big fan classic literature russian literature trouble filling library storage capacity quite large additional micro sd card case near filling storage yet book also available personal computer decide archive book necessarily want delete title altogether archive later retrieve title online account archiving title would allow free space nook recommendation silicone slip cover protect nook drop also slightly hardcover case protect nook purse book light screen backlit avoid glare downside fool think screen paper touch awe smudge reading screen,really love
332,1400532620,"[1, 1]",5.0,"I selected the black and white NOOK over the Kindle because I can download books from public libraries to my laptop and copy them to the NOOK.  We travel full time in our RV, and I have library cards in three states.  I can always find books I want to read from the libraries.  I haven't bought a book since I bought the NOOK four months ago.The display is incredible.  I sit in the sun and read a lot, and the brighter the sunlight, the better the display.  Try that with a traditional LCD display.  Since the black and white NOOK has no backlight for the book pages, it requires as much ambient light as a traditional paper book.

335,1400532620,"[8, 8]",5.0,"First let me say that when the Nook first came out on the market it caught my eye. I begin to research e readers.. I even went to the store and tested the nook, played with it. I went to other stores that had other e readers and looked at them as well. Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!**************Update****************5/30/2011The Nook is still awesome... Since I have owned the Nook for a while now, I came back to offer an update..As far as downloading books, I downloaded books the other day and before I could blink they were on my Nook!I am still happy with my Nook and love my Nook! I have recommended the Nook to friends and family who have also made purchases and are happy with the Nook as well.The performance of my Nook is awesome, and I have had great experiences with my Nook since the day I was surprised with the Nook as a gift! Best gift anyone can give! The joy of reading!I take my Nook with me every where! My children are still in love with my Nook and love to play the games on my Nook or read a book. My husband even likes for the children to read books on the Nook. The Nook has brought so much fun and the joy of reading to our family!You can also go to Barnes and Nobles and take classes to learn more about your Nook as there is so much to learn and so much that the Nook has to offer. Check in your area to see what times your local Barnes and Nobles offers classes.I also like the Nook because the Nook continues to educate you on a daily basis with the daily blog of what took place on the days of the week, for example if you turn on your Nook right now and go to the daily, it will inform you what took place on this date. Which to me is a neat feature as you get to learn something new about something you may have  not known.As far as the touch screen part of the Nook, we love it! It does not distract us but adds to the beauty of the Nook in our opinion. It is easy for my family to use.********2012 Update*****Well it is 4/24/2012 and I still love my Nook and my Nook still works great! I just wanted to give another update for individuals looking for a e reader.As of this date, our children are now asking as they did before can they have my Nook. And for now they can use my Nook, but I still love Nook and I am not ready to give my Nook up. One day we will purchase Nooks for the whole family.As far as use, I was out in the sun and reading with no problem. So many e reads and tablets are currently on the market. This nook still works for me and still performs and amazes me. There is still so much to learn with the Nook I currently own. If you are looking for a great affordable e reader. Don't over look Nook.  Good luck with your decision.Hopefully this update will help you in your decision. We would by one hundred more and pass them out as gifts and charity, just so people can get to read and find joy in reading!

336,1400532620,"[1, 1]",1.0,"I've owned this original Nook for two years now and have read dozens of books on it.  I've also spent dozens of hours on the telephone with Nook support and other activities related to keeping it running.  I'm an experienced software designed/programmer, engineer, etc. and I can assure you that compared to a paper book, this is a seriously flawed concept.  If you insist on buying an eBook reader, make sure you allocate plenty of time that you could have better spent on reading a real book to spend on arguing on the telephone with foreign call center reps.  B&N;'s concept of customer support is severely lacking and they appear to have little knowledge when it comes to supporting electronic gear.On top of those problems, consider the very concept of the electronic book.  While you will pay close to the same price you'd pay for a real book on sale, you won't own the book - you'll have a license to use it.  When you're finished with the book, maybe you'd like to be able to loan it to a relative or friend, but you can only do that if they have a Nook and you can loan it for two weeks only.  I suppose when the two weeks is up, the borrower sees the book disappear, finished or not.And then there's the odd problem of your Nook for some reason being tied closely to the email address you had on file with B&N; when you registered your Nook.  I recently had to change my email address and updated my B&N; account with the new address and new B&N; password.  After that, I could no longer download books, and was unable to unregister and register my Nook (that was supposed to fix the problem, according to the support center).  If you happen to get yourself into that dilemma, be ready for a long drawn-out session on the telephone.  The problem was that B&N; neglected to spell this situation out on their website when I changed my email address.So, if you're into ""going green"", driving a hybrid car (and thinking it's going to save you money in the long run), then the Nook may be for you.  If all you want to do is read, forget the Nook and go to the local library or bookstore and spend your time reading.  Give the price of the Nook to a local charity.

339,1400532620,"[144, 149]",5.0,"I've had my Nook for about 2 weeks and love it. Before I purchased it, I spent weeks researching the differences between the Barnes and Noble Nook and the Kindle and other ereaders. I chose the Nook because I can read .epub format books on it; something you cannot do on the Kindle. The Kindle only supports .pdf files and ebooks in the proprietary Amazon.com format. That severely limits the number and type of ebooks you can read.With the Nook, I have borrowed free ebooks from my local library and within minutes downloaded them to my computer and then transferred them to my Nook. AWESOME! In addition, unlike the Kindle, I can read free ebooks available from Google.The only thing I don't like about the Nook and the Kindle is that neither one of them has a back-lit screen so, at night or in the dark, you have to have alternative ample light. So I either turn on a lamp or use the small, clip-on light I bought at the local RiteAid for about $10. It works just fine.So far, I have had no problems navigating my ebooks; everything works smoothly and the pages turn quickly. I'm enjoying the convenience of being able to travel with 30 books and audio-books at a time. I also have some music loaded on my Nook so I can listed to it while I read.

(I have a teeny tiny little hoarder of books inside of me!) But then I finally caved and decided to try one because of my difficulty in reading larger and heavier books laying in bed at night, and due to being away from home for periods of time where I couldn't easily carry a dozen books with me.The first reader I had experience with was when my grandpa had purchased one of those huge honkin' Kindle DS readers with the full key pad. I was excited about that one, but the price was WAY out of range. I decided to try and go with the Nook (after my typical pre-purchase ritual of spending days doing research on the best option) and I was so thrilled with it, I had nothing bad to say. I used that little beauty for a few good years, until I was forced to sell it to help pay bills. From the very moment the Nook left my hands I regretted it. I was certain I'd never find one that good again. And I don't believe there has been any readers since then that are that good still!Fast-forward to this Black Friday. The FIRST Black Friday when I actually HAVE some money to spend! And I am looking for a really good e-reader! I did come across the Nook on Amazon, and saw the new Nook Simple Touch, which intrigued me, because I wanted to stick with the e-ink display, and not have a full-size touch screen battery killer. Finally, I realized my love for the original Nook had never died, and it still had everything I could ever want in an e-book reader. I was even able to buy one from a vendor here on Amazon, who lived less than half an hour away from me, and it only cost me $50!!!

The device is VERY light...feels like holding a small clipboard. I find myself touching the reading part of the screen....just a bad habit as I am used to using my iphone.  As with any device, you might want to breeze thru the manual first because I sure didn't...took me a while to figure out that the ""n"" on the front is the ""home"" key.The craftsmanship feels pretty low end.  I think if for some reason it fell out my hand, it would definitely break.  i have never dropped it...that's just my opinion.  Battery life is good...tho using the wifi decreases the battery life a lot faster.  Though this can browse the net, don't even think about having a good experience doing that...the browser sucks.  Keep in mind, this is not a computer, nor a pocket PC/tablet PC...so if you're looking for something to browse the net, you should buy something else.On a whole, I find the device to be a little slow, but great for what it is intended for. it probably ""turns"" the pages as fast as you would turn the page of a real book.  I'm already used to fast devices, so that is probably why this seems slow to me.**International Buyers**This device will download books if you're outside the US, however, you need to have a credit card that was issued from the US to purchase the books.

349,1400532620,"[9, 9]",5.0,"I received the Nook as a Christmas present.  I already own a Kindle latest generations, 3g/wifi.  However I soon discovered that not all books are available on the Kindle and 99.9% of the books I couldn't get on my Kindle are on Nook.  After much research I soon learned that if you want good ebook reader you buy either a Kindle or a Nook.  So I asked Santa for it.I will not tell you I like the Nook better than my Kindle or my Kindle better than my Nook.  Both have excellent features that make them both excellent ereaders.Here's a few on the Nook:  1- It keeps the book title, time, and battery charge visible while reading.  2-It starts up just a bit faster than the Kindle.  3-You can use your own photos for the screen saver and wallpaper.  4-it recognizes the table of contents in PDF books.  5-it reads EPUB file types (meaning you can buy books from Borders.com too and read them)As for the Kindle here are a few features I love about it:  1-I like the real keyboard as the buttons are much easier to push than on screen.  2-It reads PDFS much better than the Nook, more so when you have the PDF converted.  3-the page turns are a bit faster.  4-I prefer the black housing to white.  5-the reading page/screen has no glare at all (the Nook's little color panel on the bottom is very reflective) and it seems the print is a little darker.Both the Nook and Kindle are very easy to purchase and load books on.  I think the thing I was most disappointed in with the Nook are the covers.  They are not enough covers that actually close, like the Kindle and when sticking this reader into your purse or bag, you don't want the cover to open and scratch the screen/reading surface.If you are looking for a great ereader, you cannot go wrong with this Nook or the Kindle latest generation, in my book they are both on the top shelf.  Now if we could just get one that is a smashed together version of both their great features into one unit.Update:  After using both my Nook and Kindle for a while now I've decided I do like the Kindle much better than the Nook.  The page turning buttons on the Kindle are very very light touch, the reading screen does have darker print, and the collections feature is top notch.  Now my Nook, the buttons take some pushing to turn the pages, the reading screen is lighter, and the shelves option is ok.  What I don't care for in the shelves feature is I can't colapse the shelves to just show the shelves and then open them when I want to search in them.  I also don't care for the B&N; Library being seperate from My Documents.  On the Kindle these are all included together and you can sort them out using collections.  With the Nook you must use the naviation screen to switch between them.  I've also had some trouble with the navigation screen on the bottom.  I don't have large fingers and don't wear long fingernails so moving around on the screen should be easy.  However, when I'm tryting to scroll or select something on the touch screen I just can't seem to get what I want.  But when I don't mean to move on the touch screen but accidently touch it, I trigger a menu move.  It's still a very good reader, but when comparing options and usability, I'd choose the Kindle any day over the Nook.  I'll purchase most of my books on the Kindle and what isn't Kindlized will go on the Nook.",2010-12-26,AOY9SZTMNQWAW,Mercedes,Excellent reader,1293321600.0,1.0,2010,12,3334.0,16,received nook christmas present already kindle latest generation g wifi however soon discovered book available kindle book get kindle nook much research soon learned want good ebook reader buy either kindle nook asked santa tell like nook better kindle kindle better nook excellent feature make excellent ereaders nook keep book title time battery charge visible reading start bit faster kindle use photo screen saver wallpaper recognizes table content pdf book read epub file type meaning buy book border com read kindle feature love like real keyboard button much easier push screen read pdfs much better nook pdf converted page turn bit faster prefer black housing white reading page screen glare nook little color panel bottom reflective seems print little darker nook kindle easy purchase load book think thing disappointed nook cover enough cover actually close like kindle sticking reader purse bag want cover open scratch screen reading surface looking great ereader go wrong nook kindle latest generation book top shelf could get one smashed together version great feature one unit update using nook kindle decided like kindle much better nook page turning button kindle light touch reading screen darker print collection feature top notch nook button take pushing turn page reading screen lighter shelf option ok care shelf feature colapse shelf show shelf open want search also care b n library seperate document kindle included together sort using collection nook must use naviation screen switch also trouble navigation screen bottom large finger wear long fingernail moving around screen easy however tryting scroll select something touch screen seem get want mean move touch screen accidently touch trigger menu move still good reader comparing option usability choose kindle day nook purchase book kindle kindlized go nook,excellent reader

352,1400532620,"[161, 171]",5.0,"I have been an Amazon fan for a long time. My first attempt at owning a Kindle resulted in two failing devices for which I eventually obtained a refund.My birthday is today; my brother asked me what I wanted two weeks ago and I told him the Kindle. Unfortunately at that precise moment Amazon was right in the middle of rolling out the new Wi-Fi only Kindle and all models were unavailable.  So, I went for the barnes & noble nook Wi-Fi only.Considering my previous experience with the Kindle, I tried not to get too excited. I went on the net to read reviews of the nook and was fearful. I read that it was buggy, that it lagged when you changed pages, that the touch interface was not all that responsive.All of this was wrong; the page turns are quick and do not interrupt the flow of reading.  The touch interface is very nice and I like seeing my book covers in color. When you choose the Cover Flow, your books slide by with the touch of a finger and you simply tap on the book you want to read at that moment.  This was surprisingly helpful when I went to make purchases on the B&N; Store. I know you don't judge a book by its cover, but how many times has a nice colorful packaging led me to a book I wanted to read, uhm; many times. I was really intrigued with the ""swipe"" page turn that you used the touch screen for, however this did not seem to function correctly on the store model or on my own nook. Strangely, after a period of time, it now works perfectly. A representative told me it simply had to adapt to my touch...I don't know how much I trust that statement, however when she turned a page on the display nook it responded to her very well. (Perhaps it was a learning curve?)Side-loading documents: Wow, if you have any epub or pdf documents all you have to do is side load them and voila.  I do recommend a free program called Calibre, which organizes your books, helps you edit the tags, add a color cover, or convert to epub. Pdf is not very easy to read on the nook, but if you convert to epub it goes smoothly, unless there are alot of photos or images, which lessens the accuracy of the conversion. Calibre has even converted files like, Word-Doc, Html, Palm, etc. Calibre will let you pick and choose books to upload to the nook directly from the program; in other words it 'sees' the nook.Drawbacks to the nook: The battery life, that nifty little color touch screen eats the battery power like mad.  B&N; claim that you get 10 days, cut that in half. I do not know if this is because I use the touch screen to do my page turns or not,(the other option being the side buttons) but I am leaning toward, maybe? LCD screens notoriously use power; but using the page turn function does not require the back-light to be on, so I am not sure how it is eating up the battery so badly. It is honestly not that much of a problem for me. I am around my computer so much that it is unlikely a day will go by without it being attached to the CPU or an outlet next to my bed. I have gone almost four days with not re-charging; and I could see that little power icon decrease at least to slightly more than half in that time.Oh - and that nifty little cover flow on the color screen.  Don't expect it to work for Your Documents.  (There are two libraries, the B&N; purchased books and your side-loaded books or documents.) Also there is no way to sort your documents to your specification so you either sort by author, title, or the date you loaded them, very annoying if you build up a nice library; which is highly likely considering you can add an SD card to your nook and increase memory to 16 maybe 32 gigabytes. Speaking of which with that ability to increase memory, it would have been nice if the MP3 Player interface were a little more sophisticated.  An interesting ability is to play an unabridged audio-book and read the book at the same time. I am not sure who would do that, but then again I understand spoken Spanish more than I am capable of reading it.  This might be useful to me in that area, if I can find the matching audio-book/ Spanish-book. (Nuance in foreign language is often lost in English translation.)Never having owned a functioning 3G eBook-reader, I never really missed it with my home Wi-Fi. I have discovered several places close to where I ""haunt"" which have AT&T; free to my nook. I already have a huge collection of books lined up for me to read... so feeling a ""need"" for the 3G seems unlikely. I have always done this, collected books that line up, ready for me to read. (By the way... the in store B&N; Wi-Fi connection has s*cked at every B&N; store I have been to. Amazingly Border's free Wi-fi worked better, I just couldn't buy through the B&N; store. I had to go to my smart phone, buy the book, and it uploaded.)So how do I feel about my nook; I absolutely love it! To be fair however, had I received a functioning Kindle, I would have felt the same way about it, I am certain. I think the Kindle has deficiencies with the lack of a touch/color interface and the side loading documents ability. However, that screen kills the battery as I stated.  The reason for liking the separate touch interface is that you don't want to touch your e-ink screen; I don't see how Sony's all touch interface e-reader is going to be popular when you are smudging your read screen all the time, though I must admit I would like to try one out.The nook is comfortable in all sorts of positions, laying in bed, on the couch, holding it next to you; even laying it away from you and increasing the font so that you could read without holding it. I highly recommend a reading light, especially if you had grown accustomed to reading LCD screens in the dark (my kindle program on my Android phone.)It is rather frustrating, I would have preferred a Kindle simply because I was impressed with Amazon customer service when my Kindle malfunctioned.I do recommend the nook. It would be nice if they would lessen DRM restrictions so I could buy books from Amazon or any other place for that matter.SincerlyR",2010-08-18,A2Q5OH3DGQGMXD,"Rob ""riverstone""",nook wifi is it a worthy e-reader?

353,1400532620,"[11, 11]",4.0,"First off, I want to start out by saying that I love my Nook. My friend is an employee of B&N; so he was there to help guide me along in my selection and answer any questions I had. So, yes, I did have a little bias to the product to begin with. However, for what I need, this is perfect in almost every single way. In my review I'll compare the Nook to the Kindle ($139 version) and it's major differences, just so people know what I'm talking about in terms of other products as we go down the list.The Bad (If you want to call it that):1. The Nook is a little heavier than the Kindle. I'm not sure of the exact weight differences, but just by feel alone it is a tad bit heavier. Now, that can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. I for one don't find it to be a deal buster, the weight is not catastrophically heavier and uncomfortable, but it is heavier than the Kindle. I do think, however, that the durability of the Nook is a little better compared to the Kindle. The Nook has built in paddles to turn the pages, while the Kindle has flappy paddles along the side that feel as though they could break if I dropped it on it's side or if I touched it to hard. My suggestion for anyone interested in buying the Nook is to also buy a carrying case for it so it makes it easier to read, almost as if you were reading a real book. The covers at B&N; usually start around $30.2. The Nook does have a touch screen that has a bit of glare to it. Some others have posted their reviews of how they dislike the glare when the touch screen goes dark. For me it is a bit distracting if you find yourself wandering away from the text. However, whenever I read a book I find many distractions around me while I read. It's not a huge deal in anyway and some have posted if you turn it to the right angle you won't see your reflection. Again, not a deal buster in anyway I wouldn't think.3. The start up time is atrocious. I can't defend this one in anyway. Amish people can put up houses in a faster amount of time before the Nook would have a chance to get to your homepage. Ok, so not quite that slow, but you get the idea. I haven't timed it yet but I'm going to take an educated guess that it takes around 1-1/2 minutes to start up. That is something that should have been addressed from B&N; to begin with. Again, I can't defend this one in anyway.Ok, so what you have all been waiting for: The Good1. The extra storage feature is superb. The Nook comes with a built in 2GB storage space. Enough for most people, 2GB will get most every book you want to read in your Nook with no problem. However, if you are a fanatic reader that has Newspapers and Magazines delivered to your Nook everyday or every week, this can begin to take up space if you don't free it up. But don't fret! The Nook comes with an extra storage slot for your SD card that can hold up to whatever the highest SD card space is out there. The great thing about it is, SD cards are a lot cheaper today than you would have found 3 years ago, so adding space is cheap.2. The Nook has a featured called ""LendMe"". This is something that the Kindle does not have and I'm sure for competition sake will have in the future. This a great, great, great feature to the Nook! If you have any friends, family or co-workers that have a Nook and have a book on theirs that you would like to read, you can hook up wireless or through the computer and Lend them a copy of it for up to 14 days. If you're a fast reader then you can knock out a 500-600 page book in easily 14 days.3. Your county library might be on the list of Nook rentals. In the county in which I reside in North Carolina, our county library is fortunate enough to have a system in which I can rent books for 14 days from the library. This also is something the Kindle does not have. Before I go off on how great the feature for renting books is, I should point out that the library is going to have a limited selection of books for you to rent. I'm a big Thomas Sowell reader and he has approximately 30 books out on the market. However, the county library that I rent from has only 1 book from his selection. So do you're research before you buy a book, your county library might have it already. The feature, as I have seen, is relatively easy to use. You do have to hard wire your Nook to your computer after you download some software, but it's really simple and the kind people at your local county library can assist you on how to do this. In fact our county library had everything we needed in terms of software and directions on their website.4. Finally. You can take your Nook to B&N; and read any book for up to an hour. Recently I went to grab some coffee at B&N; and wanted to read a book on Ireland. Popped open my Nook, connected to the B&N; network (already programmed into your nook for ease), selected the book I wanted to read from the list I searched on, and wam-bam I was reading a book. You can read lots of books on one Nook from their online selection without having to lug 20 actual books that you wanted to compare before you bought.In closing on this review I would say first and foremost do your homework. Go to B&N; or BestBuy and try out the Kindle, Nook and even the Sony Reader. Some will really like the touch screen of the Nook compared to the touchpad of the Kindle, but it's all in what you like. Some will like the fact you can Lend books and some won't.I'm sure I've missed out on something that others would like to know about the product before buying, so if you have any questions please contact me back here on Amazon and I'll try to get to you as quickly as possible.",2011-01-02,A20Y7REXQZ1REW,Ryan Kurtz,"Great Item, But Does Have a Few Flaws",1293926400.0,1.0,2011,1,5644.0,37,first want start saying love nook friend employee b n help guide along selection answer question yes little bias product begin however need perfect almost every single way review compare nook kindle version major difference people know talking term product go list bad want call nook little heavier kindle sure exact weight difference feel alone tad bit heavier good bad thing depending look one find deal buster weight catastrophically heavier uncomfortable heavier kindle think however durability nook little better compared kindle nook built paddle turn page kindle flappy paddle along side feel though could break dropped side touched hard suggestion anyone interested buying nook also buy carrying case make easier read almost reading real book cover b n usually start around nook touch screen bit glare others posted review dislike glare touch screen go dark bit distracting find wandering away text however whenever read book find many distraction around read huge deal anyway posted turn right angle see reflection deal buster anyway think start time atrocious defend one anyway amish people put house faster amount time nook would chance get homepage ok quite slow get idea timed yet going take educated guess take around minute start something addressed b n begin defend one anyway ok waiting good extra storage feature superb nook come built gb storage space enough people gb get every book want read nook problem however fanatic reader newspaper magazine delivered nook everyday every week begin take space free fret nook come extra storage slot sd card hold whatever highest sd card space great thing sd card lot cheaper today would found year ago adding space cheap nook featured called lendme something kindle sure competition sake future great great great feature nook friend family co worker nook book would like read hook wireless computer lend copy day fast reader knock page book easily day county library might list nook rental county reside north carolina county library fortunate enough system rent book day library also something kindle go great feature renting book point library going limited selection book rent big thomas sowell reader approximately book market however county library rent book selection research buy book county library might already feature seen relatively easy use hard wire nook computer download software really simple kind people local county library assist fact county library everything needed term software direction website finally take nook b n read book hour recently went grab coffee b n wanted read book ireland popped open nook connected b n network already programmed nook ease selected book wanted read list searched wam bam reading book read lot book one nook online selection without lug actual book wanted compare bought closing review would say first foremost homework go b n bestbuy try kindle nook even sony reader really like touch screen nook compared touchpad kindle like like fact lend book sure missed something others would like know product buying question please contact back amazon try get quickly possible,great item flaw

355,1400532620,"[7, 7]",4.0,"With these new ereaders on the market, the act of reading has come back to be a very ""in-style,"" technologically advanced and hip thing to do in 2010. Books are now less intimidating and more fun and convenient, and this becomes only more encouraged through Barnes and Noble's Nook.Now, to cut to the chase, the Nook can do most things that the Amazon Kindle can do as well, and while the Kindle holds some ground over the Nook, on an overall scale, if you're looking for a better and more convenient ereader, I'd say to go for the Nook.Both the Kindle and Nook have clear displays, but overall, I would say that the Kindle's display seems to have better resolution. The Kindle also beats the Nook on battery life (as you'll notice that the Nooks battery life seems to last about a week, whereas the Kindle about a month, this is due to the draining power of the Nook's light-up touch screen menu). People may also prefer the button keyboard operation of the Kindle over the Nooks sometimes annoyingly sensitive or not-sensitive-enough touch screen. The Kindle is also thinner and lighter than the Nook. Both have mp3 features though, which helps them. It's always great to be able to read to your favorite music.Now, while it may seem in this paragraph the Kindle has the Nook easily beaten, one must look deeper into finding out why the Nook is a better choice. The reason the nook beats the Kindle is easy - in its navigation, presentation and overall ease of use.The biggest problem with the Kindle (that I noticed) is that the Kindle seems to want to have the look and feel of navigating like a laptop computer in the way it presents the main menu and font size, style and book selection. The problem with this is one thing - this is NOT a computer, it's a portable book, and Barnes and Noble knows this, and made their unit feel way less like just another annoying technological gadget but instead with a ""browsing bookstore"" type of presentation. This is a very BIG difference between the two, and you can sense it even after just a few minutes of toying with it. And this is only talking about the OLDER Nook, I can only imagine how much more amazing of a presentation the color Nook can get with all of its full color pictures and extras.On top of this, the Kindle seems to have placed the turn-page buttons way too attached to the ends, so you actually end up hitting the buttons by accident way too often, whereas the Nooks buttons are more of a soft ""bendable plastic"" type, so you never hit them by accident. This, on top of the little things like being able to slide your finger on the touch screen to turn pages as well as getting book covers and previews, daily logs, etc, give the nook an overall more ""coffee house"" feel which the Kindle doesn't even come close to. And even though the Nook is bulkier and heavier, it actually is made of a more durable softer rubber-like material, and along with the white paneling it makes it feel overall way more professional and studious. Not to mention just more attractive and stylish. This is easily the hipper of the two ereaders. Therefore, things like slightly longer load times, heavier feel, sometimes annoying touch screen and slightly higher price are actually very tolerable once you pick up both units and see and feel the overall difference.Books are an old-fashioned type of entertainment, and while the Kindle tries to make reading and literature just another tacked on 21st century technological piece of unrelatable modernized hardware, the Nook walks the perfect line of bringing the ""old-fashioned"" hobby of reading to a hipper style for the 21st century without taking away the studious professionalism of reading or disrespect the art of literature either. The transition is so much smoother on the Nook that you'll forget you're even reading off of an electronic device.",2010-12-17,AMGGZCWY3VNZC,S.

I love everything about the Nook and BN reader store. The Nook is bigger than the Sony Pocket Reader and after reading the Nook for awhile - I just could not go back to reading something on the Pocket Reader. I like the fact that you can enlarge the print up to extra extra large and choose between several font styles.  I like the clock at the top of the reader so now I don't have to waste my morning reading time on the porch by constantly running in to check the clock in the kitchen to see when I need to get ready for work.  I like the fact that you can look at the covers of the books when you want to pick out what you want to read next.  I like that you can add so much extra space to your device (the Pocket reader only accepted 150 books before freezing and acting up). I really like the fact that you can preorder ebooks which will just download to your device when they are available.  I like the fact that the power cord is $14.99 so I can buy extra (one for home, one for work) - where Sony Reader's power cord was almost $30.00.

359,1400532620,"[3, 3]",4.0,"My wife received a basic Nook for Christmas.  Being electronically challenged, she immediately plopped it in my lap with instructions to ""Buy me a book"". As the nearest B&N; store is 30 miles away I elected to follow the B&N; site to my PC, to the Nook route.  Opening an account on the B&N; site, purchasing a book and downloading it to my PC was easy and fast. Prices are about half that of a printed version. Passing it along to the Nook was another matter.  The Nook came with virtually no usable instructions, either printed or electronic, to explain the procedure that I wanted to use.  After going back to the B&N; site I discovered a little free program called ""Nook for PC"". After downloading that program I was able to copy the book from my PC to the Nook. Everything works fine now, and my wife is addicted to the thing, she takes it everywhere. She still will not, however, try to load new purchases on the Nook.We now have three copies of every book we have purchased, one on the B&N; site, one on my computer, and one on the Nook. With one Nook, it is pretty hard to share after she finishes, and although I can read the books on my PC, that just is not comfortable or practical.  I personally think $150 or so for my own Nook might be a little too much so I am going to look into a cheaper alternative. Walmart has one or two for under $120, one for under $90 that some people like.The Nook is a good option if all you want is a book reader.  The other functions do not seem to work well enough to be practical. The Nook might be a little expensive for what you get, but the service at the B&N; store we visited twice was excellent.  One evening after dinner we visited a B&N; store with Nook in tow. After my wife found a book she wanted, we took the book and the Nook to the Nook counter.  The attendant was happy to purchase the book with her Nook and download it for her.  The book cost for $24 and change, downloaded to the Nook, $12 and change.

363,1400532655,"[11, 15]",3.0,"I knew about the NOOK Color even before it was released and I was really excited about this ereader, because I own a Kindle 3 and I'm part of the customers that think that it could offer more things and be more en par with the future. The NOOK Color has many features that appealed to me like touchscreen, vivid view technology, brightness adjustments, really nice web browser and mp3 player, etc. So I decided to order one with BlueProton cause they ship it to Canada, and I paid 60 dollars more than the actual price at B&N; and expedited shipping taxes on top of that. I didn't care, I just wanted my NC cause honestly I'm just tired of buying AAA batteries for my Clip light to read my Kindle 3 in bed. I noticed I never read in bright sunlight, I'm an indoors type of reader and I also like to browse while I read, mostly wikipedia and google and the Kindle we browser is primitive.Anyways, I got the NC promptly, I was super excited, but then I tried to transfer my epub books to it and noticed that my computer didn't recognize the unit's drive. Nothing popped. I had my iphone and my kindle plugged in and they were right there. I went to a friend's house and nothing popped on his computer either. A third try at a different laptop and same thing: nada. I went back home and kept trying and all of a sudden I started seeing smoke coming out of the USB port and a smell of burned toast. Really strong. I knew that unit was gone and that freaked me out. Everything else worked perfectly, but the USB was pooched. I returned it and they were very professional about it, but said that they found nothing wrong with the device. I bet they just reset it and tested ome of the features without actually testing its hardware. Anyways, I said I didn't want that unit back. Now here I am, with no Nook Color, nobody else sends it to Canada. I'm contacting friends in the US so I can send it to them, buying it straight from B&N; and then they can mail it to me. It's just weird that at this day and age we still can't have items shipped internationally, even when we're willing to pay more money for that luxury.Now I'm again using my Kindle like crazy, since it's all I got and it never fails. But I'm still gonna buy the NC no matter what. I just don't know if I'll sell my Kindle 3 in the future or keep it because it has sentimental value now, hehe.I think that for 249 US dollars, the NC is the best e-reader in the market. Right now the Kindle still leads and the iPad is coming strong, but 2011 will be the year the Nook Color will establish itself as a great competitor for these other two. If Amazon doesn't come up with a color Kindle with touchscreen, I strongly believe they will be the Betamax and VHS of the 2000s. But I really like the Kindle and if they came up with something like a reader's tablet, I would use it instead of using B&N;'s. However, that still hasn't happened and Jeff Bezos says he doesn't want that to happen just now.

366,1400532655,"[11, 11]",4.0,"I have been working on my fiction writing skills, and wanted an eBook reader so that I could read a variety of other novels to learn from them.  The Kindle is a great device, but I really wanted a color screen.  The iPad would have been a nice option, but was a bit expensive for my taste and a bit too large.  The myriad Android tablets on the market don't seem to get great reviews, though I suspect that will start to change once Android 3.0 is available.The Nook Color was a nice alternative.  Priced a little higher than some of the no-name Asian tablets, but far less than the iPad.  It supports multi-touch, has a decent color display, and the ability to insert micro SD cards into a slot near the ""loop"" on the bottom.Because it supports both ePub and PDF out of the box, you can find a nice selection of books to download (legally) on the web and read on the device without additional investment.  The Barnes and Noble site also offers a limited, but growing, selection of electronic books (both free and for-a-price).  If you get tired of reading, you can use the built-in WiFi and browser to surf the web.  You can also play a couple of the built-in games, with the promise of more coming in a future update from Barnes and Noble.My only complaints so far about the device are that the far edges of the touchscreen seem a little unresponsive, the micro-USB connector is a non-standard type that seems to require use of the proprietary cable.  The connector on the device itself seems to make poor contact with that cable, which makes it difficult or impossible to read on the device while it's charging.Apart from that, battery life has been really good.  I rarely have to plug it in before I am finished reading for the day.The built-in web browser works well, displaying pretty much any web site that an iPad or Android phone can handle.The WiFi seems to find and hold on to signals well, and I don't recall it dropping a connection so far.If you take the time to learn how to ""root"" the device, you can add the Android Market to it and many apps (like the Kindle app) work very nicely on it.  This gives you the best of both worlds in a sense... The ability to buy eBooks from Amazon and Barnes and Noble, while keeping your color display.As far as eye strain goes, I work at computers 8 or more hours a day on the job and more when I get home.  I find the Nook's display easy to read for hours at a time and don't feel that my eyes are any more strained than when I read a printed paper book.  But your mileage may vary.  If e-Ink works better for you, the Kindle is a great alternative.I like the ability to highlight parts of the books I'm reading, take notes inside the book as I read (e.g., to highlight particularly good dialogue, characterization, description, etc., as a writer), and to post updates to Twitter and Facebook about your progress through a book.All in all, this was my favorite 2010 Christmas gift and has (for me) eliminated any desire to own an iPad or any other eBook reader.",2011-02-19,A37E5KVAKOZFVS,Amazon Customer,Very nice eReader with tablet functionality,1298073600.0,1.0,2011,2,3014.0,43,working fiction writing skill wanted ebook reader could read variety novel learn kindle great device really wanted color screen ipad would nice option bit expensive taste bit large myriad android tablet market seem get great review though suspect start change android available nook color nice alternative priced little higher name asian tablet far less ipad support multi touch decent color display ability insert micro sd card slot near loop bottom support epub pdf box find nice selection book download legally web read device without additional investment barnes noble site also offer limited growing selection electronic book free price get tired reading use built wifi browser surf web also play couple built game promise coming future update barnes noble complaint far device far edge touchscreen seem little unresponsive micro usb connector non standard type seems require use proprietary cable connector device seems make poor contact cable make difficult impossible read device charging apart battery life really good rarely plug finished reading day built web browser work well displaying pretty much web site ipad android phone handle wifi seems find hold signal well recall dropping connection far take time learn root device add android market many apps like kindle app work nicely give best world sense ability buy ebooks amazon barnes noble keeping color display far eye strain go work computer hour day job get home find nook display easy read hour time feel eye strained read printed paper book mileage may vary e ink work better kindle great alternative like ability highlight part book reading take note inside book read e g highlight particularly good dialogue characterization description etc writer post update twitter facebook progress book favorite christmas gift eliminated desire ipad ebook reader,nice ereader tablet functionality

The capacitive touch is not perfect, and the narrow metal rim of the screen ensures one ends up touching the screen and changing things inadvertently. There is only one option for a page turn; lefties beware. The battery life is far shorter than the time necessary to read a medium length book, and the plug-in is at the bottom of the unit. Since the cable is specific to the NC, I hated to risk bending/breaking it as I can imagine it is pricey to replace so plugging in the unit usually meant it was time to put the unit down for a LONG time while it recharged. I traveled with this unit, and it did not get me from one airport to the next on a charge. A lot of the ebooks I own are in .pdb format, which B&N sells, but the NC does not read. I was having problems with the unit not doing the motion side-turn and read thingy, and B&N pretty well ignored me. The local manager reminded me that used units are no longer subject to help.

I'd get crazy messages and images on the screen, but no access to function. I went online to see if other buyers had the same problems and possibly solutions. They did. Lots of complaints and a few helpful suggestions. The things I had to try were a nuisance but they worked when I was persistent. I learned to fuss around and get the thing started. Then the charger started failing. I'd have to position it a certain way and weight it down when it was attached to the NOOK. That worked for awhile. After awhile, it seemed clear that something was wrong with the connection so I bought a Nook-compatible charger from Amazon. Good news. It worked. Bad news. It worked for only a week. I called Nook Customer Service. They said I really needed a Barnes & Noble brand charger. So I laid out another $15 or so. That charger worked for about 3 days.Now the EEG for my Nook has flat-lined.

372,1400532655,"[2, 3]",3.0,"I purchased two certified nook colors directly from B&N;, for my kids to read ebooks on, and for some entertainment on long trips, Dr's appts, etc.Things I like about the device:-versatility- now has netflix- great little device for entertainment, as well as reading.-user interface:  much improved following the last update, both navigating the device itself and B&N;'s store.-option for expandable storage- handy for music and mp4's.-ability to make the device 'kid friendly'; the internet can be disabled, and purchases can be made to require your account password.Things I dislike about the device:-Read in store feature only for certain books, and virtually no kids' books.  The impression I got from B&N;'s webpage was that it was for all ebooks.  This was the main reason why I picked these up instead of waiting for the Kindle Fire to be released.  Major disappointment.-Charger cable sucks.  The cable itself is weak where the usb adapter attaches to the cable, and is very easy to bend and break.  one cable is now broken at that spot, and the other is close to it.  These cables are easily replaceable, so not a huge deal, but I expected better quality...  Also, the power adapter is quite bulky.-did not update automatically.  I had to manually install the most recent update (allowing me to disable internet, and install netflix). it was relatively easy to do, following directions from B&N;'s webpage, but there should be a way to check for updates from the device itself.-loses battery life fairly quickly while on standby.-no free games & limited games (maybe apple spoiled me...)-prices for apps and books seem generally higher than on my kindle (I have not made direct comparisons, this is just my general impression)I will try and see if I can lend books through my local library; this may allow me to use it more for it's intended purpose.Overall, the device itself is quite good- just not for what I had intended it for (in store reading- with the option to purchase the book, in print, from the store).If I had purchased the device for myself, however, it would have been returned.  My kids do enjoy reading on it, playing angry birds, watching netflix, etc. so I will keep it for their use.Edit:The nook colours use a usb longer than a standard micro usb; a standard micro usb cable will not charge the nook colour.  I did contact B&N; (I initially took my nooks into a B&N; store for assistance, and was referred to their tech support 1-800 number.  So much for the in store tech support...)

373,1400532655,"[2, 2]",3.0,"I am the occasional reader but, I bought this for tablet capability.  It can be rooted in about 2 minutes to have app store.  Once that is done, You can use a home screen alternative and program to switch it to hide the overbearing and hindering B&N; store.  It's still there but, not right in my face. Default browser is OK  but, I prefer Dolphin HD.  It's much more than half and Ipad at exactly half the price.  Plus, when used as a reader, it's just light and small enough to be effective at that purpose.  I had a Pandigital novel that I got for Xmas that completely died in 3 weeks.  I took the refund money and made the smartest purchase that I can remember making:  The Nook Color.  The novel is pure garbage compared to this device.  Android 2.1 is so much better than 1.6.  I also couldn't get many apps to run on the novel  where this runs almost everything. Spend the extra $ and get the color.  Save the extra money from the Ipad. I was considering Archos 70 but, I couldn't find anywhere to actually play with it.  Plus, given their history; I had decided against it.Good:Nice screen,  capacitive touch,  strong wifi, decent battery life, Nice CPU @ 800 MHz,  512 MB RAM  Ipad only has 256  supposedly), Tons of free apps available, very reasonably priced,  portable,  Barnes and Noble magazines  very reasonably priced at $1 to $3 an issue), microsd slot.Bad  minor complaints):that silly plastic thing in the corner, mono speaker, micorsd slot instead of sdhc card slot, doesn't come with android market.Overall this is the best tablet for the money currently and probably will be for quite a while.UPDATE.  Couple of small annoyances: randomly reboots instead of sleeping, wireless doesn't come back up sometimes after rebooting.  Still very happy with it though. Sleep issue apparently also happens to those who haven't rooted.  I'm sure it will be fixed with update.UPDATE:  I am very unhappy with Barnes and Noble's many attempts to update my firmware without my permission.  They have tried twice and didn't succeed.  I believe that AVG antivirus is stopping it.  They got my girlfriend's and we have the same nook, that came with same firmware, that was flashed with same mod.  The only thing I can think of was AVG must have stopped it.  They got hers weeks ago and mine is still fine.  She wasn't running AVG and mine was.  It's the only thing I can think of.Who else does that?  I have items from Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, HTC (Sprint), etc and NONE of them update my property.  Who do these people think they are? Well, they won't be updating my firmware and now I won't be buying books from them either.  Anyway, it's an aging piece of hardware and now for a bit more money something better can be bought.Side Note:  I had ordered a touchpad from B&N; back on AUgust 21st.

My favorite is the kindle fire...1.) poor customer service from barnes and noble - the cable breaks easily, and this device is not compatible for swaps... what I mean is like on the kindles you can basically switch out the cables for any micro usb cable... nook color you can not do that... once your nook color is out of warranty, they will no longer replace the cable, so if it breaks, your like SOL until you buy another one for $19.95 + shipping + tax... The cable is really cheap and breaks to easily... I think each time I've had a new cable replaced I could only get it to last about 2-3 uses before it broke... it keeps breaking at the N...2.) the updates are horrible... basically you will have lag issues and the battery will drain easy if you don't update... actually after a while the battery will just start draining anyways and you can't keep charge...3.) it takes forever to turn on... you have to wait like 5 minutes and keep holding the power button and then like another 5 minutes to boot up... with kindle it turns on almost instantly.... After a while, you still have to wait about a minute for the kindle to boot up, but it still loads quicker than the nook color.4.) a feature i like is that the volume buttons are on the side... with kindle fire, you have to dig around to find them... they are in the settings... like you can only adjust the volume on kindle fire through the settings...5.) another feature i like is the card expansion slot. i like to store avi movies from my camcorder and what not on them, and you can't do that with the kindle fire.6.) check each stores content before you buy. each ereader loads different files... this is the main reason i bought both. Most of my textbooks for school are only available through barnes and noble, but I prefer to read on the kindle. After I'm done with school, I'm going to be selling my nook color, but I refuse to get rid of my kindle fire, unless they update to one that has the volume buttons on the side, and plossibly a card expansion slot.

After playing around with many different readers, over a period of several weeks, I finally decided to pick up a Nook a couple of months ago.One of my big considerations is that I wanted to be able to read .pdf files in color. The Nook easily satisfied that requirement. What I was expecting; however, is how FANTASTIC the Nook is after Android is installed on it. A friend of my just bought a new iPad 2 and showed it to me a couple of days ago. That, of course, is a wonderful device but VERY expensive. I started to look around the 'net and found that the latest Android Operating System, Honeycomb, can be installed on a micro-SD memory card and that this will allow the Nook to run the new OS. Even better, by simply removed the micro-SD card, the Nook returns to it's normal state and continues to run as before.I had NO IDEA how powerful the Nook Color really is until I installed Honeycomb on it. The Nook is now so great that it behooves me that B & N doesn't simply place Android on the Nook as the default OS! Yes, it's its that good! Just one word of caution. As using Honeycomb doesn't require that the Nook be rooted, it is a bit tricky to install but that's only due to the HORRIBLE instructions that the geeks who discovered how to put Android on the it. (As a rule, Geeks are usually incapable of writing in known-human languages.) I don't know if the warranty is voided by running Honeycomb but, as all that needs to done to get rid of it, is remove the micro-SD card, I suspect that no one will know.All in all, the Nook Color was already a great device but adding Honeycomb makes it AMAZING!",2011-03-21,A3KFIMCP87VH4U,BookMan,All I can say is WOW!!!,1300665600.0,0.8,2011,3,1775.0,23,held e book reader long time kindle always expensive even like way screen flash turning page playing around many different reader period several week finally decided pick nook couple month ago one big consideration wanted able read pdf file color nook easily satisfied requirement expecting however fantastic nook android installed friend bought new ipad showed couple day ago course wonderful device expensive started look around net found latest android operating system honeycomb installed micro sd memory card allow nook run new o even better simply removed micro sd card nook return normal state continues run idea powerful nook color really installed honeycomb nook great behooves b n simply place android nook default o yes good one word caution using honeycomb require nook rooted bit tricky install due horrible instruction geek discovered put android rule geek usually incapable writing known human language know warranty voided running honeycomb need done get rid remove micro sd card suspect one know nook color already great device adding honeycomb make amazing,say wow

380,1400532655,"[8, 8]",5.0,"I haven't really given up my Kindle (which I love and has its advantages). However, I got a deal on a Nook Color that was impossible to ignore and so I made the jump. If you're wondering if it's worth 2X the price, IMO it depends on your needs and wants. For people who want to create an inexpensive e-reader/Android tablet by rooting the Nook -- or if you love to read periodicals or books with lots of images -- the Nook Color is the way to go.It's surprisingly heavy to hold -- MUCH heavier than my Kindle with a cover. The battery life means you CAN'T be far away from an electrical plugin. My last charge lasted 2+ days with playing games, an animated screensaver and some reading. It's also wireless only.The backlit LCD screen is spectacular and I find it was better on my eyes for reading than I expected. However, I find that finding ebooks on B&N;'s site is harder than Amazon and I cannot find many inexpensive or the oodles of free ebooks like for Kindle. Lots of ebooks promoted on B&N;'s Nookstore are $4.99 - $9.99 or more. Too expensive, IMO. Seems like fewer Indie Authors on there in the $2.99 price range :(I decided to take a chance and rooted my new Nook Color which requires a micro SD card (I used a 2G card). It requires the ability to follow some technical steps that took me about 15 minutes total. I am not a major Geek, but I've been online for 15 years and know basic stuff like HTML (not needed for this) and moving files and some troubleshooting if I get stuck. The Rooted Nook is a bit quirky. While the original B&N; e-reader functionality is still there, I had to install a couple apps (launcher app and Softkeys) to toggle between the Android and B&N; screens.I CAN watch YouTube and surf the web easily. I also downloaded the Amazon Kindle app to my rooted Nook, and read my 100+ Kindle books on it (and get my freebies too!). You can't view Flash or use Hulu or Netflix (yet!), but maybe flash will work with the next B&N; update. note that a Nook Color doesn't have a mic or bluetooth to use with certain Android apps. A bummer for me because I like to dictate texts and emails on my phone using Nuance's FlexT9 app.Overall, my kids **love** the Android side of the rooted Nook Color, and I like getting some useful apps on a much bigger screen.

383,1400532655,"[7, 10]",4.0,"Before I get started, I'll just say that my review comes from the unit we got at the bookstore to display. The overall product will still be the same, but some things (like the instruction manual) might be different.---------Reading: It's a nice clean picture & the backlit screen isn't too annoying, but I have a feeling that people will be feeling the eyestrain later. If you're looking to buy this for reading at length, you'll need to be aware of this. You can change the brightness of the page, but that doesn't change that ultimately you're still looking at a backlit screen.Downloading: Pretty fast download times, although I only downloaded the free samples from the storefront. (Hilarious since I work at a Books-A-Million & the storefront's B&N.; We're so going to lose money on ebook sales.)Internet: Pretty decent. I pulled up facebook & the page is crisp, clear & loads quickly. I also went onto failblog, a site with quite a few side ads. It was a little on the slow side, but that's to be expected on stuff like this. You can also pull up videos on youtube, so that's a bonus.Battery: Not bad, but obviously won't last as long as the Nook or some of the e-ink units out there. You'll get about 3-4 hours if you leave the wifi on. Not sure about the non-wifi battery life right now, but since the company says it's 8 hours I'd say it's probably about 6-7 hours.Extras: You can change the font, screen background color, & a few other things. While that's nice, I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed by it. There's also the option to be able to toggle back & forth between the publisher default & your aesthetics of choice. You can also change the background on the main page of the NookColor, which is a nice touch. Since we're not supposed to change that with our store unit, I wasn't able to play with that any.Touch Screen: It's OK. Pretty easy to use, but a few times I found myself really having to wrestle with it to turn pages. Sometimes it would be too sensitive & I'd end up a few pages ahead of where I wanted to be. Not a deal breaker, though. It didn't happen enough to where I'd get overly irritated, but people who are all thumbs with touch screens will be irritated.User Friendly: It's not very intuitive to use. People savvy with e-readers & gadgets will be able to figure it out pretty quickly but people who are new to the scene will be pretty confused with everything. The unit for my store didn't come with any written directions- it was all on the unit. That means that if it's like this on the sale unit then that won't be all that helpful for the people who aren't able to navigate well on the unit.Overall: My opinion is that it's OK, but not exceptionally so. Go for the iPad if you really want something like this. (I know it's more expensive, but if you're willing to pay $300 then paying $500 might not be that much of a difference.) It's basically a Nook/iPad hybrid, but without the option for all of the extras & apps. (Of course if all you want is an e-reader & wouldn't use the iPad's extras, then this is great.) Overall it isn't a bad unit but it just doesn't have anything to really make it stand out. If you're a big fan of the Nook then go for this unit, but I'd play with it in the store first.The only two things that really make this stand out from the other e-readers on the market is that the unit is in color and that the internet on this unit is far better than some of the other options on the e-reader market. While the color option is great for children's books & magazines, this might not be enough for users who predominantly use their readers for plain print reading & that the ones who would want these things might already have it in the various tablets that are on the market.I did enjoy playing with the unit in my store, but I don't know that I would choose it over the regular Nook. Of course this is just my opinion, but again- before making a big purchase like this, view a unit in the store first.3.9/5",2010-11-26,A2XNOB1T796Y6B,"ChibiNeko ""Sooo many books, so little time!""","Not bad, but might not sway many users of other readers on the market",1290729600.0,0.7,2010,11,3984.0,69,get started say review come unit got bookstore display overall product still thing like instruction manual might different reading nice clean picture backlit screen annoying feeling people feeling eyestrain later looking buy reading length need aware change brightness page change ultimately still looking backlit screen downloading pretty fast download time although downloaded free sample storefront hilarious since work book million storefront b n going lose money ebook sale internet pretty decent pulled facebook page crisp clear load quickly also went onto failblog site quite side ad little slow side expected stuff like also pull video youtube bonus battery bad obviously last long nook e ink unit get hour leave wifi sure non wifi battery life right since company say hour say probably hour extra change font screen background color thing nice help feel little underwhelmed also option able toggle back forth publisher default aesthetic choice also change background main page nookcolor nice touch since supposed change store unit able play touch screen ok pretty easy use time found really wrestle turn page sometimes would sensitive end page ahead wanted deal breaker though happen enough get overly irritated people thumb touch screen irritated user friendly intuitive use people savvy e reader gadget able figure pretty quickly people new scene pretty confused everything unit store come written direction unit mean like sale unit helpful people able navigate well unit overall opinion ok exceptionally go ipad really want something like know expensive willing pay paying might much difference basically nook ipad hybrid without option extra apps course want e reader use ipad extra great overall bad unit anything really make stand big fan nook go unit play store first two thing really make stand e reader market unit color internet unit far better option e reader market color option great child book magazine might enough user predominantly use reader plain print reading one would want thing might already various tablet market enjoy playing unit store know would choose regular nook course opinion making big purchase like view unit store first,bad might sway many user reader market
384,1400532655,"[5, 6]",5.0,"I'll admit, I bought it to hack it.  If you have no interest in hacking this device, then let me start with the ""stock"" review first.As an eBook reader, it is very good but not great.  eInk and its variants will always be the gold standard by which you measure a reading device, because the utility of such a display in daylight is unrivaled.  My hope is that in time, the Pixel Qi displays make their way into Kindles, Nooks, iPads, etc on such a large scale that this is no longer an issue.  Alas, it remains one, and it is a key criterion for many.  As an LCD touch screen, it is very bright and colors are rich, not saturated.  Touch sensitivity is a little rough, as is accuracy.  I did not see a calibration function.Wireless connectivity is very, very good but for some reason, will not connect with some routers.  The range is impressive, better than my Droid 2.  Speeds are very good, but I neglected a speedtest in this round.Integration with the B&N; store is very tight as expected.  The store app for the Nook is better than the Android app, necessarily: you can browse magazines and newspapers, for one thing.  Display of media is well-formatted and fairly intuitive; I never cracked the user manual or quick start guide (then again, I rarely do that for anything I buy). Prices are competitive with other vendors, and it does handle sideloading of books onto microSD cards.  By the way, 32Gb microSDs are supported.  I run with an 8Gb, and I've filled it mostly with music.And oh by the way, it plays music very well.  Some of you might listen to music while you read, and I am one of those weirdos.  This device, stock, will do just that.  Overall, I like this device, but would probably prefer eInk if I was buying it solely for reading media.However, I bought it for cheap tablet use.  In this regard, it has amazing potential.  Despite the fragmentation of custom ROM and rooting options, you can indeed settle on a Cyanogen ROM and find a lot of functionality on the cheap.  I can browse websites easily if I don't need Flash (currently not working on this ROM); I use PocketCloud to log into my home machines and I can work from there if needed.  I'd love to have Swype on this, or even Graffiti, but it is sufficient to have access to the Android Marketplace and all the attendant apps I have stored in the cloud.  There is no microphone or camera, so those apps have no place here, nor does GPS exist.  However, Bluetooth is available in Cyanogen nightlies so you can now try pairing it with headsets and keyboards.  Thus far, the potential is not fully realized but it perfectly suits my needs today.  With time, this will become a great tablet once Flash is fully operable and the Honeycomb ROMs are fully baked.Stock, 4 stars.

385,1400532655,"[8, 9]",4.0,"First off, do not expect Nook Color to do wonders.  It is not meant to be tablet or an iPad replacement.  It is foremost an e-Reader with some bells and whistles.If I'm given a choice, I would not buy a Nook.  For the price, I would rather get a Kindle Fire.  I own 4 laptops, 1 iPad 2 for my wife, and 3 Kindle Fires for my kids.  Nook Color is an afterthought and it is for me.  I bought my used Nook Color on another site for $114 (free shipping) 2 weeks ago.  And it was a steal.  The Nook I received was in working order and it looked new.I had no trouble turning it on and everything worked perfectly.  The only gripe was it was extremely slow compare to some of the tablets I own.  Again, I reminded myself that this is not a tablet so I had to be fair.  The features are not too bad but the navigation was confusing at best.Fast forward to today.  B&N; was smart to release an update (1.4.1).  If you already own a Nook Color, you should get the update.  The update improves the speed dramatically.  The navigation still lacks finesse though.Here are some of the goods- I bought it cheap- It has an expansion slot.  I inserted a 16GB micro SD card and Nook recognizes it right away.- The web works fine.  It can now even watch some YouTube.  It also runs Flash.  Nook 1, iPad 0.- The new update allows NetFlix to run.- There are some apps that are extremely useful.  I love the Smithsonian Channel and Pulse.- The magazines look great.  The update also improve the navigation.- The interactive books are great.  My daughter absolutely loves it.And now the bads- I constantly look for free stuff.  Unfortunately, B&N; doesn't offer a lot of free books that are worthwhile.- The apps itself, is sad to say the least.  The offering is a fraction of what you can find in iPad and Amazon.  And most of them are costly too.- While the update improve the speed of web-surfing, it still is slower than iPad and Kindle Fire.- The speaker is terrible.  It is located on the back of the device.  If you hold the Nook on your hand, you may cover the speaker. The best solution is to use a head phone.- The navigation overall needs to be improved. It is a basic Android without much thought.  At times I don't even know whether to double-tap or hold to get more options.Here is my final take.  If you are short on cash, and would like a good e-reader/tablet.  Go get a Kindle.  If you can find a Nook for less than $150. Go for it.I would not spend more than $200 on a Nook (be it a Color/Tablet).  There are much better options out there.Update January 24, 2012I have used my Nook for a month now and all in all, I like it because it allows me to read my magazines and books.  It sure beats a 10 incher tablet.  The update 1.4.1 is definitely a must if you want to use Nook Color to its full potential.  However, I found out yesterday that the update was actually used to close the loop on dual-boot and disable any sideload of apps.  The version 1.4.0 allows the Nook to load Amazon app and the Launcher EX.  Basically it allows other apps other than B&N; to be loaded.  The automatic update 1.4.1 disable this option.  So, if you are dare enough to install other apps, you can backdate the version to 1.4.0 if you want to load other apps.Update February, 2012Nook continues to lose to Kindle Fire in terms of contents.  B&N; could not match to the behemoth of Amazon and I don't think it will ever be.  However, if you are stuck with Nook, there are a few apps that you must have (they are all free).  It helps the Nook Color to be a good companion in a boring world.- NetFlix is a must.  7 inch on your lap and plug in a pair of headphones.  You are good to go.- Smithsonian is interesting.  Want to learn something that you forgot.  This app works great but contents updates are slow.- Dolphin Internet Explorer works great for anyone wants to do quick surfing.  Very fast and very convenient.- Don't know what interest you, try Stumbleupon.  It randomly pulls internet content based on your interest.  Works great on YouTube vidoes.- Good with words, try Nook Crossword.- Who doesn't use Dropbox.  It is a must.- Springpad is great to jot down quick notes.- Pandora works great too, but you need a pair of headphones though.- Who needs newspaper when you have Pulse.",2011-12-14,A102RLOGIBBDMW,"Cool Chris ""Cool C""",Not a bad product and close to being perfect,1323820800.0,0.8888888888888888,2011,12,4267.0,44,first expect nook color wonder meant tablet ipad replacement foremost e reader bell whistle given choice would buy nook price would rather get kindle fire laptop ipad wife kindle fire kid nook color afterthought bought used nook color another site free shipping week ago steal nook received working order looked new trouble turning everything worked perfectly gripe extremely slow compare tablet reminded tablet fair feature bad navigation confusing best fast forward today b n smart release update already nook color get update update improves speed dramatically navigation still lack finesse though good bought cheap expansion slot inserted gb micro sd card nook recognizes right away web work fine even watch youtube also run flash nook ipad new update allows netflix run apps extremely useful love smithsonian channel pulse magazine look great update also improve navigation interactive book great daughter absolutely love bad constantly look free stuff unfortunately b n offer lot free book worthwhile apps sad say least offering fraction find ipad amazon costly update improve speed web surfing still slower ipad kindle fire speaker terrible located back device hold nook hand may cover speaker best solution use head phone navigation overall need improved basic android without much thought time even know whether double tap hold get option final take short cash would like good e reader tablet go get kindle find nook less go would spend nook color tablet much better option update january used nook month like allows read magazine book sure beat incher tablet update definitely must want use nook color full potential however found yesterday update actually used close loop dual boot disable sideload apps version allows nook load amazon app launcher ex basically allows apps b n loaded automatic update disable option dare enough install apps backdate version want load apps update february nook continues lose kindle fire term content b n could match behemoth amazon think ever however stuck nook apps must free help nook color good companion boring world netflix must inch lap plug pair headphone good go smithsonian interesting want learn something forgot app work great content update slow dolphin internet explorer work great anyone want quick surfing fast convenient know interest try stumbleupon randomly pull internet content based interest work great youtube vidoes good word try nook crossword use dropbox must springpad great jot quick note pandora work great need pair headphone though need newspaper pulse,bad product close perfect

The colors are stunning and the build quality is excellent.  It is not as fast as my IPAD2 but it's no slouch either.  The screen is very responsive to the touch.  The Nook Color is perfect for someone who is looking for a device that is optimized for ebooks yet allows email, web-surfing, and video.  It even does flash which my IPAD2 doesn't.  I probably won't root it because for my wife's purposes it pretty much does everything she needs, but it can be rooted and used as a full fledged Android tablet.  I really like this device.

387,1400532655,"[10, 10]",4.0,"EDIT - Update 1.4.1 (12/21/2011): BIG update rolled out on December 14th, with lots of big changes, most of which really improved the device.First, the ""n"" key, which originally functioned as a home key taking you back to the original home screen, now functions as the menu key instead, like on the new Nook Tablet. Prior, there was a softkey arrow that would bring up the menu function, and Barnes and Noble has moved that function to strictly hardware. I'm torn about whether I like this update, because honestly, I don't like relying just on a hardware key for something like a menu, especially with the issues I've had with Nook parts (I've owned two cords in the past year alone.) It does makes multi-taking easier, when switching from one application to another (say reading to internet), because you don't have to go to the home menu function first. For those of us Nook Color originals, it takes adjusting from old habits, but so far, it's not a bad change.The reader application functions in a much more friendly manner. The page numbers are on the bottom of the pages, instead of the top, in a much less chintzy font, and pulling up the menu tell you how many more pages are left in the chapter. Not really a necessary change, but kind of nice. There are some fonts added, along with FINALLY adding the option to change the tone of the page from white to sepia, night, or off-white. The books also read sideways now, in a two-page fashion, though I'll admit, I don't use that much, and won't, even with the ability to have it on something other than kids books. Just makes the actual reader app a much more rounded and friendly one.The magazine reader had a few changes that are nice. There are animations for the page turns now (though why they don't have that option with the books is a big of an in-congruency), though the animations disappear when you zoom in. The menu at the bottom pulls up the pages in miniature picture form, but are in a much more appealing, accessible manner. Rather Mac-esque, really. Nothing huge, but it makes it all more friendly-looking. Randomly, the magazine reading app is the only one where the ""n"" button is still a home button, and not a menu one. Wondering if they'll notice that and change it in the future.The PDF reader had some AWESOME changes. Before, reading PDF files was incredibly clunky, and did not resolve well on the screen at all. Reading a book involved zooming in and scrolling down, instead of sideways like the ereader application, and when you closed the PDF file, reopening would take you right back to page one, and never saved your last place. Ridiculously cumbersome, and not user-friendly at all. The new update not only saves your place, but it resolves the page so that the text fits better on the screen, and allows the pages to read much more easily sideways. It also scrolls sideways, instead of down, which just makes sense and follows with the overall expectations of the reading experience.Interestingly, enough, they still haven't resolved the issue of PDF files not having a cover when on the home screen or in the menu, even when the information is attached, which is something I was hoping they'd resolve. It's not a huge issue, but it's just a visual annoyance when all the EPUB files have cool graphics show up on the home screen, and PDF files just have grey with the title of the book. Lame.Overall performance of the menu functions and flipping between tasks seems zippier than it was before, and I really appreciate that. The menu functions seem much more efficient and smooth, and that just makes for a much better interaction.The ebook store also changed around, and B&N; completely reordered all the categories and changed the look. I can't say I appreciate all the changes they made, because you can no longer organize things like apps or books based on price, and instead have to search manually in the menu. I'm frugal, I'll admit. I miss the ability to find free apps easily, because let's face it, it just makes me happy.Overall, I love the update they rolled out, though! It's nice to know that B&N; is staying loyal to their original customers and keeping the devices updated.*  *  *EDIT 4/12/2011: Barnes and Noble did an update recently which fixed the glitches with the screen when plugged in, finally. I have not had any issues with the screen lagging or glitching since.*  *  *EDIT 2/28/2011: A new update now allows for Android apps and email on the Nook, which is exciting. I'm not all that into the apps they have, especially the games, but it's a nice touch! It has also fixed the issue of not being able to put your own books on the home screen, and the issue that the Nook was having with recognizing cover art for those books. I can now also put other apps on the home screen, such as the Email or Pandora app, which gives the entire thing a much freer, most customizable feel. Though apparently this update has cancelled out the last one, because the screen glitches when plugged in are back. Oh, well, I'm just happy to now be able to put my own books on my own home screen! Vast improvement right there!*  *  *Original review, from 12/2010:I received my Nook Color as a gift for an early Christmas, and have been using it for a few weeks now, enough time that I decided I can make an educated review.Pros/Cons-It has a great screen, with sharp resolution. Book title colors and wallpapers look sharp and clear, and the touchscreen is responsive. You can adjust the brightness, though I rarely found the need to adjust the brightness even a quarter of what it could be, since otherwise it was a bit too bright on the eyes. That being said, I found that when you plug it in to a power source and try and use it, the touchscreen goes crazy, and won't even perform simple tasks like unlocking the device. You can't flip to the next screen without several swipes, and turning pages can be a haphazard activity. That weird glitch doesn't affect the device at all when it isn't connected to a power source, but it's such a pain when the device is low on battery power and you want to read while it's charging.-The hardware on the Nook Color is nice, with a muted metallic finish on the front and back, which gives it a nice grip, though I immediately bought a cover, so the fact that it's somewhat grippy doesn't matter much any longer. The weight is nice, about the weight of a small hardcover book, which I found rather pleasant when holding. I still don't get the random open-hole thing in the lower left-hand corner, though. It's like you're supposed to use that to clip the device onto something, but I hardly thing someone is going to just clip it onto their keychain for convenience. It's clearly not awful-looking, but I guess it just seems kind of superfluous to me. Oh, well.-The battery life is surprisingly good. I don't have to WiFi on when I'm at home, and the device will go for several days on low-brightness. I actually had it on one charge for about 7 days one time, and was pretty impressed, considering other devices with LCD features tend to eat battery life like some kids eat Cocoa Puffs.-It's Android-based, which is great. However, B&N; doesn't allow any apps from the Android market, which is such a crime, considering that the tablet could be a fantastic tool if B&N; would open up the gates on that one. The fact that it's Android-based isn't really a selling point, it's more of a potential point to keep an eye on, one that hopefully the company will do more with down the road. The tablet does come with certain apps like Pandora and games like Sudoku, which will do in a pinch if you're bored.-It comes WiFi enabled, and it connects to networks easily and without issues. It does recognize B&N; WiFi hot-spots, and remembers them, which means that you don't have to reprogram the networks or worry about not being able to access the in-store features, which is really convenient. The browser is pretty decent, doesn't have flash, but performs very well. I actually used it for emails and checking my Facebook when I was out of town, and it was snappy and quick, though the fact that it doesn't have pinch/pull zooming features (which the picture gallery does, oddly enough) is a bit of a turn-off, because it can make browsing somewhat clunky and inaccurate.-The B&N; store they have on the device is convenient, loads content easily, and is very user-friendly to navigate. Once you have your information in, downloads are quick and easy, and you can also set a password for downloads, to prevent someone downloading books without approval. Also, if you have a gift card for B&N;, you can use it to buy books, but you have to go online to your account first, and save the information on your account before it'll charge it, and it'll always charge to that card first before your credit card, which is a pretty cool feature.-The reader itself is awesome, and you can sideload your EPUB files easily onto the device from your computer and start reading them immediately. You can't, however, read PUB files like you can on a regular Nook, which I found obnoxious, since I have a lot of eBooks in that format (that are from a B&N; affiliated website, no less). You also can't put files that HAVEN'T been downloaded directly from the B&N; store on the device over WiFi onto your home screen, so in order to pull up your own personal files sideloaded onto the device (even ones downloaded directly from B&N; online), you have to go into the Bookshelf menu and go from there. Which means that if you don't have WiFi all the time (as I do), very few of your books will be able to be put on your home screen, which is such a childish thing for B&N; to do, really. It takes away the personalization that the tablet could do so well, and bothered the heck out of me when I first discovered it. Granted, you could probably fix it by rooting the device, but you run the risk of other issues in the software when you do that, so hopefully B&N; will come out with an update to fix that annoyance.-The Nook does read PDF files, but it's a very awkward process, since the screen ratio doesn't fit the allotted size, making the text tiny and incomprehensible, so trying to reads books in that format is a headache; zooming in is awkward and clunky, and takes to long to be worth the effort. Also, closing and reopening the file takes you back to the first page, which, if you're attempting to read an extensive document in several sittings, gets really old really fast. If you have book in PDF form, I would suggest downloading something like Calibre and converting them to EPUB to save yourself the trouble.-Music loads and plays easily, though I honestly haven't used that feature much, since I have an iPod, and if I want a playlist, I go from there. Pictures also load easily, though you have to have it in the gallery/grid feature to see previews, otherwise they are just displayed with file type images until you click on them to open. Silly little issue, but again, something B&N; will hopefully fix in the future.Anyway, great product, but really, more potential than actual greatness at this point. I love the fact that I don't have to leave the house to read a book, which is great since I'm at home with an infant all the time. Is it worth the money? If you buy it directly from B&N; online, it's $249, which isn't an awful price for touchscreen reader (it's really only about $100 more than a regular Nook or Kindle), so I would say that yes, it is. It's just still somewhat disappointing that it feels like it's half-finished, but I'm looking forward to see where it all goes from here.",2010-12-27,A2YM85TO0H2JET,D.

388,1400532655,"[3, 3]",5.0,"For me, this is a better purchase than the Kindle Fire. I just bought this Nook color tablet from Best Buy two days ago,  It's perfect.  After charging it, I drove straight to Barnes & Noble books to try their wifi and buy a few books. TRUST ME, THE Barnes & Noble bookstore employees know how to operate the Noook, and did a better job than Best Buy, at showing me how to use the Nook and answer my questions.  The set up and navigation is easy, and the user settings are user friendly. When reading books, I found that the bright white background screen was hurting my eyes.  So I lowered the brightness level down to half of the default setting.  Yes, you can adjust the brightness as well as the volume.  Nice Browser: when using the browser, it accesses the internet very quick.  While using the wifi in the B&N store, I accessed Hulu plus (The video website).  I was in the Barnes & noble store watching an episode of Law & Order.  HOW COOL IS THAT?  The weight is a little haavy in your hand when reading books, but no where near as heavy as the Kindle Fire.

391,1400532655,"[16, 20]",4.0,"I have been down and up with this reader for the past 5 months, but since April, it has been a joy.  B&N; has gotten its act together.  The problem I had with not being able to open books has been solved. B&N; not only finally found out what caused some books to lock up but also how to restore them.  There is no longer any problem with opening any books.When I first bought my reader, the tech support people were not well-trained. They are now.  I have 80 books on it and no problems with any of them.Now, the goodies:  B&N; just introduced Enhanced Editions of some books. These have videos, audio clips, animated maps, etc.embedded in the text.  It's wonderful.  I'm reading D-Day, and throughout there are newsreel segments pertinent to the text.  For instance, you read about Eisenhower and then play the video of him talking to his troops before they embark for the Normandy Coast.  You don't just read about bombing or fighting,you hear and see as well. It's a whole new reading experience and available only on the NOOKcolor (or the iPad with the NOOK app.)Pictures in magazines like National Geographic are gorgeous.  They look better than the print versions. There is a selection of apps for the NOOKcolor, with more coming out all the time.However, if you want all the Android apps, then  you can get an N2A SD card on Amazon that turns your NOOKcolor into a full Android tablet with access to the Market. You then  have the option of booting the reader up as a NOOKcolor or an Android Tablet.  You can even get a Kindle App so you can get and read books from Kindle on your NOOKcolor.Some people say that the backlit screen has glare and that you can't read it outdoors.  Not true.  I read my NOOKcolor in my sunny back yard all the time, and, although I'm a 76 year old lady, I can read for hours on it with no problem.Now for the goodies besides the Enhanced Editions.  You can get an app that allows you to work on Office documents on your reader.  Downloading files, pictures, and music is a breeze.The NOOK also allows you to borrow ebooks from public libraries.  All you need is a library card.  Libraries all over the US are lending ebooks.  So, you don't have to buy all the books you want to read.  That's a big saving. And, it takes less than a minute to download a  book.  You just connect your reader with a USB cord and Adobe Digital Editions displays the books you've borrowed & you drag the ones you want to the My NOOKcolor shelf.  As with Kindle, there is also a Lend Me feature so that your friends can borrow from you.The touch screen is very sensitive and I'm very clumsy, so it took me awhile to be able to navigate easily, rapidly, and without bringing up unwanted menus.  But that was true of the iPhone when I got my first one,Why don't I go all the way  and give this 5 stars?  Because the device doesn't have a ""sync to farthest point read"" feature, so if you decide to look at an earlier page,the only way to get back is to use this awkward slider bar.  I can never get it to stop at just the page I want.  The same is true of clicking on endnotes.  When you're through reading them, you have to navigate backwards to the text. There is a Back button displayed on the Notes page, but it disappears before you can read your note.  B&N; has some work to do on this.In sum, if you buy it at Barnes and Noble, the NOOKcolor is only $249, half the price of the cheapest iPad or even Android Tablets.  Yet, for $39.95 more you can get the card to turn it into a full Android Tablet.  It is incredibly more versatile than the Kindle. Page turning is smoother than on the Kindle--or am I the only one who sees the afterimage of the page you're going from while you're turning pages on the Kindle?  On the NOOKcolor, like the iPad, you just touch and you're  on the next page.One other thing: naturally, a touch screen will get smudged.  B&N; says to wipe it with a dry microfiber cloth.  I found that didn't clean it enough.  If the screen isn't clean, it can get jumpy.  So, knowing that the iPhone has a capacitative touch screen as does the NOOKcolor, I tried using the products sold in the Apple Store to clean the screen.  They work perfectly.As mentioned in my earlier review, I also like the NOOKcolor feature of your being able to share a passage with a friend without leaving the page you're reading.  Also, I find the Web browser is just fine. In fact, when I'm  reading and see a name or word I need more info on, I just touch it and when the popup appears, I choose Wikipedia or Google and surf to my heart's content. Then I just touch the ""book"" icon on the lower screen and I'm back to the page I was reading.  It's smooth and fast.I belong to Goodreads and when I'm through with a book, I can just go to the Goodreads app on my NOOKcolor and post my review immediately.

394,1400532655,"[6, 6]",4.0,"This is my first E-Reader, so my target audience for this review are primarily those who are also considering this relatively new technology.MY INITIAL REQUIREMENTS:In anticipation of some heavy travel, I decided that I needed something that would allow me to purchase and store enough books to last me 6 months. More importantly, I wanted something that would allow me to highlight and take notes on passages. Finally, if the physical copy of a book had pictures in it, I wanted to be able to see those pictures on my E-Reader.WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--One of the first things to attract me to the Nook was its simplicity. There are only 4 buttons to be seen: A power button, Volume Up, Volume Down and the Nook ""Menu"" button. The buttons are inconspicuous and don't protrude.--I was able to download almost all of the books I was looking for from the B&N; shop. To be fair, some of the stuff I read is relatively obscure.--I like the ability to highlight passages with different colors and take notes.--I like that it shows pictures from books.--Although it wasn't something I was looking for at the start of my E-Reader search, I found that I liked the built-in games (Chess, Sudoku, Crossword puzzles, etc).--Finally, the touchscreen is pretty responsive (not perfect) and the menus are mostly intuitive.A FEW THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE NOOK:--As mentioned earlier, the touchscreen is good, but not perfect. It can be really touchy and trying if you're trying to get a certain passage highlighted. Even more difficult is trying to navigate web pages using the browser. I don't recommend the Nook as a Netbook or iPad replacement, but it is nice if all you use it for is downloading more books or reading some online news.--Pictures from physical books sometimes show up on the Nook version of the book. When they do (like maps in fantasy novels) they are usually much, much smaller. Unfortunately all the Nook books I've seen don't allow you to resize or zoom in on these maps or pictures.OVERALL:For the most part, the Nook met my initial requirements. Some things I didn't think I'd use much before (Chess, etc) I actually use fairly often and will come in handy to pass away the time on a long plane flight or layover.If you want something that will just read books, then I'm sure you can find something better. Likewise, despite all the extra feature that the Nook has, it is no threat to the iPad.But for those that are looking for something in-between, the Nook is a handsome, intuitive and reasonably priced alternative.",2011-04-18,A3S1YIQQW7AZO,EMAN NEP,KINDLE KILLER?,1303084800.0,1.0,2011,4,2537.0,14,first e reader target audience review primarily also considering relatively new technology initial requirement anticipation heavy travel decided needed something would allow purchase store enough book last month importantly wanted something would allow highlight take note passage finally physical copy book picture wanted able see picture e reader like nook one first thing attract nook simplicity button seen power button volume volume nook menu button button inconspicuous protrude able download almost book looking b n shop fair stuff read relatively obscure like ability highlight passage different color take note like show picture book although something looking start e reader search found liked built game chess sudoku crossword puzzle etc finally touchscreen pretty responsive perfect menu mostly intuitive thing like nook mentioned earlier touchscreen good perfect really touchy trying trying get certain passage highlighted even difficult trying navigate web page using browser recommend nook netbook ipad replacement nice use downloading book reading online news picture physical book sometimes show nook version book like map fantasy novel usually much much smaller unfortunately nook book seen allow resize zoom map picture overall part nook met initial requirement thing think use much chess etc actually use fairly often come handy pas away time long plane flight layover want something read book sure find something better likewise despite extra feature nook threat ipad looking something nook handsome intuitive reasonably priced alternative,kindle killer

399,1400532655,"[22, 90]",1.0,"Yesterday I spent over an hour playing with a real Nookcolor at my local B&N;, where I've befriended the staff as I go there almost every day as an unemployed.  Anyway, I was very dissapointed at this iteration of the Nook.First off, the Nookcolor is very heavy.  I think it's almost 1 pound, and since it's not a true tablet, you're supposed to hold it in one hand, but it'll strain your hand muscles after a few minutes.  Even the B&N; guy told me to hold it with TWO hands. That's pretty pathetic, I must say. The only way to use it for more than a few minutes is to pop it up on some support, which obviously is not convenient for a device that's primarily an e-book reader.Second, even though it's much faster than 1st- and 2nd-generation Nooks, it is still slow, especially when browsing the web.  Now, page turns are generally faster, but there is no animation, and sometimes there *is* a slight delay so you're never sure if the device registered your turn gesture.  Very annoying.Third, the screen is high-res but rather poor in contrast and viewing angles.  I think the resolution is 1024x600, and the DPI is in the high 100's, but overall I felt the screen looked coarse.  I guess for this price, they have to pick some cheapo screen, so no surprise there.  The color LCD screen, of course, draws down battery pretty quick, a fact even the B&N; staff acknowledges readily.  Also, the screen is completely unreadable under direct sunlight.Speaking of the screen, the digitizer is not very responsive, whether you want to zoom in or out or type something.  It's slightly better than my 4th-gen iPod touch but that's still a very frustrating experience.Fourth, the software is still buggy.  The demo unit in store had a few books, but half of them could not open, with some mysterious error message.  The web browser could not render several web sites I tried.Fifth, the interface is very confusing.  There is the hard nook button, there is some kind of drawer button on the screen.  After an hour I still found myself tapping the wrong button to do something.  Very dumb.Sixth, of course, you cannot access the Android Marketplace app store, at least without jailbreaking this.  Very few apps are available and there is no indication B&N; will allow more aps, since they wnat to use this sell e-books, which carry fat margins and have super-enriched Amazon and its founder.In short, this is a disappointing device, not the least because its hefty weight and barely useable screen are just ridiculous for an e-book reader.The list price is $249.99 and B&N; does offer a 30-day money back guarantee if you buy it from them.",2010-12-03,A5JLAU2ARJ0BO,"Gadgester ""No Time, No Money""","Heavy, slow, poor screen, buggy",1291334400.0,0.24444444444444444,2010,12,2630.0,31,yesterday spent hour playing real nookcolor local b n befriended staff go almost every day unemployed anyway dissapointed iteration nook first nookcolor heavy think almost pound since true tablet supposed hold one hand strain hand muscle minute even b n guy told hold two hand pretty pathetic must say way use minute pop support obviously convenient device primarily e book reader second even though much faster st nd generation nook still slow especially browsing web page turn generally faster animation sometimes slight delay never sure device registered turn gesture annoying third screen high re rather poor contrast viewing angle think resolution x dpi high overall felt screen looked coarse guess price pick cheapo screen surprise color lcd screen course draw battery pretty quick fact even b n staff acknowledges readily also screen completely unreadable direct sunlight speaking screen digitizer responsive whether want zoom type something slightly better th gen ipod touch still frustrating experience fourth software still buggy demo unit store book half could open mysterious error message web browser could render several web site tried fifth interface confusing hard nook button kind drawer button screen hour still found tapping wrong button something dumb sixth course access android marketplace app store least without jailbreaking apps available indication b n allow aps since wnat use sell e book carry fat margin super enriched amazon founder short disappointing device least hefty weight barely useable screen ridiculous e book reader list price b n offer day money back guarantee buy,heavy slow poor screen buggy
400,1400532655,"[7, 8]",4.0,"I should preface this by saying I also own a nook (non color 3g) and an iPad 3gI order a LOT from amazon so when it came down to getting an e-reader it was a tough choice to pick B&N; over amazon.Why did I do this?I still LOVE the value of a retail store, living down the street from a B&N; i go there often to shop and pick up little gifts as well as browse books. There have been plenty of books that by their cover (yes i judge) and short summary I would've bought but because of my ability to skim the book in store I have decided not to buy.Similarly there are some great books out there but for photography and coffee table type books, you really can't experience them the same way with a nook or an ipad. All that being said, I decided to support B&N; because their library is just as large as amazons and I throughly enjoy their storefronts.Ok onto the review.Reading on the nook color is easy, the Android interface is fast and reliable, not to mention easy rootable!Reading on the nook vs the nook color is vastly different because of the eink display on the nook. There is a fair amount of eyestrain associated with reading on a backlit display but I had no problems reading for well over 2 hours on it. The font was just as clear and easy to read as on my ipad.Size wise it is not much different than the original nook but is much heavier.It is lighter and easier to carry than the ipad because of its dimensions.In the end I did not buy this product to read on it, I bought it to root and use android honeycomb on it.This makes the this the best value out of any reader on the market in my opinion.The nook has virtually the same specs as the Samsung galaxy tab aside from the 3g.at $250 (buy directly from B&N;) you cannot complain, Honeycomb runs smooth and opens up an entire world of possibilitiesfor this little tablet.",2011-03-17,A1XG38WOY3LY4V,Gadgets & Gizmos,Nook for an Amazon Lover?!,1300320000.0,0.875,2011,3,1837.0,26,preface saying also nook non color g ipad gi order lot amazon came getting e reader tough choice pick b n amazon still love value retail store living street b n go often shop pick little gift well browse book plenty book cover yes judge short summary would bought ability skim book store decided buy similarly great book photography coffee table type book really experience way nook ipad said decided support b n library large amazon throughly enjoy storefront ok onto review reading nook color easy android interface fast reliable mention easy rootable reading nook v nook color vastly different eink display nook fair amount eyestrain associated reading backlit display problem reading well hour font clear easy read ipad size wise much different original nook much heavier lighter easier carry ipad dimension end buy product read bought root use android honeycomb make best value reader market opinion nook virtually spec samsung galaxy tab aside g buy directly b n complain honeycomb run smooth open entire world possibilitiesfor little tablet,nook amazon lover

407,1400532655,"[6, 7]",5.0,"I had the original Nook, had a friend's Kindle for a couple weeks, and now have the Nook Color. Although it's a bit weird to be writing a review of it on Amazon, I felt that potential Kindle purchasers should understand their options.The Nook Color is, by far, the best eReader I've used (including the iPad). It's not perfect, but it almost is. The LCD screen is very easy to read, which surprised me since I was a big fan of e-ink and did not like long-term reading on the iPad. The lack of need for a night light is great, and the software it ships with is lightning fast and almost bug-free. Really, there is no lag when I'm using it and the functionality (once you spend 3 minutes learning it) is near-perfect.BN is quickly catching up to Amazon on content...frankly don't notice a difference anymore. Plus, you can side-load eBooks from Google and elsewhere.I know this...I will never go back to e-ink again and love this screen.I also LOVE the delivery of magazines on this thing. Really, it's better than the real magazine. You get full color reproduction of text and pics, and it gives you an Article View if you just want to read the article. It is a great way to get magazines and will be better as they get more publishers (right now, it's a decent list but it could be better).I also really like the multimedia support...I can load photos and pics on an Micro SD card and take my music with me. If I'm in a wifi area, I get full Pandora support! I wish it had 3G, but this is still great.Having said that, the Color is not perfect. First off, the weight, while acceptable, is SLIGHTLY too much. It won't cause strain like the iPad and is perfectly capable of being read in bed (you can lock out the gyro so the book doesn't flip Portrait=>Landscape), but it's not the unnoticeable weight of the Nook or Kindle (or paperback). Still way better than a hardcover though.Second, the screen, while great, is slightly tactile, not glass like you would be used to on an iPhone or high-end Android phone...this is nitpicky, but I noticed it.Third, no Flash support yet (and, while it is a great web-browser, it's not a laptop, iPad, or even like my HTC Evo). This, and the lack of pinch-zoom multi-touch, affects my enjoyment of the web brower (note: you can zoom, just not pinch-zoom). UPDATE: Pinch Zoom is here! It's very good, but not great, implementation. Makes the browser that much better!Fourth, the newspaper delivery, while acceptable and similar to the original Nook/Kindle, is not good enough. Frankly, it's easier to read the web pages of the papers than on this and pales in comparison to the magazine delivery, which really is SUPERB!Finally, and most importantly, is the battery. This is not like an e0ink reader. To give you an idea, the other day, I started out with a full charge and I read around 600 pages of a book and did some light browsing. I did not use music or Pandora and did not pay any games. At the end of the day, I had to charge it again. This was about 7 or 8 hours of use. That's OK with me but it ain't the type of thing that you can go on a three day road trip without your chord like the Kindle or original Nook.Anyway, it looks like my cons are longer than the pros, but really, this is a great product.

410,1400532655,"[11, 17]",3.0,"Bought mine a few days ago and returned. It is an ok device but does not truly shine as an ereader and I will expand on it shortly.1st, this is more a hybrid device than an ereader. An ereader basically is for reading documents in an electronic format. Examples of good ereaders: Kindle (of course), Nook 1st generation and Sony. Nook Color, besides allowing you to read, let you browse internet, listen music, play some games and much more tablet oriented stuff. Of course, there is nothing wrong on that until you start thinking about how important color and internet are for just reading a simple book.So, what's cool or nice:-Internet.Full color internet experience, with nice virtual keyboard and ok browser. Touching the screen and keyboard is like an iPad or similar tablets, but is comfortable enough for short emails or using Wikipedia or Google.-PDF supportWith Nook Color not only you can read PDFs in a nice full color screen but you can expand or zoom in at will, move along pages with a simple touch or even rotate and read in landspace mode. This feature is really amazing and the selling point if reading PDFs is your only or most important task.-Full color screenPretty obvious. If you like magazines or would like to get electronic subscriptions of any of them, look no further. The resolution, colors and screen is perfect, a real pleasure to read using a NC. Depending of the magazine you can also extract or read the text or article portion only, leaving images apart.BUT!... not everything is perfect ...-No landscape mode for booksYou have landscape mode while reading PDFs but not while reading regular ePub books. This was a real surprise to me, a bad one! Landscape mode allows you to rotate and read poetry or technical books without cutting the paragraph or breaking lines. With no Landscape mode you are forced to read every book ""as is"" and for a hybrid table which costs more than $200.00, in my opinion, it is not acceptable. My Kindle 3 rotates and it's 50% cheaper!-LCD screenI must admit this device has less glare issues than iPad or Galaxy, but if you have read using eink technology you would not go back and change to LCD again. Reading on a Nook Color for several hours is not easy for your eyes. And forget about using it at your pool or outdoors, unless is cloudy or you find the perfect angle; the glare will bother you while reading anyway. Indoor is a different story but it created some eye strain on me anyway, specially after long reading sessions.-HeavyFor serious readers (those who read novels, fiction books, technical books) or more than 2 or 3 weeks per month, please think again before buying. With about 18oz your hands and wrist will start complaining soon and if you don't have a desk or something to put your NC on, your choices are using your tummy, chest, lap or knee as additional support. A deal breaker. Being a Kindle 3 owner I know what I'm talking about. You can hold a Kindle 3 with one hand and read for hours with little or no problems at all.-BatteryOnly 8 hrs of continue use, average. I bought it a Tuesday, read for about 5 hrs that day, went to bed (leave it on but in sleeping mode). Next day morning turned it on, used it 1 more hour and soon after that the device was at 16% of battery life. (I barely used internet and brightness was at minimum) Another important point about battery and charge is that the Nook Color must be charged via wall, not USB or computer unless screen is off, which means you must forget about using the device during the charging process. The adapter is also proprietary so you can't use your Nook 1st gen adapter or the one some Androids use, I don't like that, I don't like proprietary stuff. The more standard, the more common, the better to replace or find.-No zoom or ability to enlarge imagesAn image with wrapping text around in that cool book? If you can't read it or maybe is too small, then sorry...you're out of luck. You have (at the moment of this review) no way to click, expand or enlarge that image. If you read mostly novels this means nothing to you. But if you read technical books with some images or illustrations on it, the size will be so small that is basically useless and not readable at all. I can't believe this simple feature is absent and I can only hope for a future fix via firmware-Android based but not full access to Android marketShame on you B&N.; This device could be a real hit if was not so closed or locked. As usual, this device will be hacked for those with brave hearts or basic computer skills (actually, it has been) but warranty will not be honored and it's a hassle to keep it up to date after official B&N; firmware upgrades, in case you hacked or rooted the device; also you won't be able to read books in-store if you root it. While B&N; keeps selling the unit without Android Market or a restricted version of it, this device will be like having a Magnum revolver in your hands without any bullets. So much power with Android/Linux but you just can't use it.-No ""read me"" featureFor a $200.00 tablet, I would expect this feature. The Kindle it's not so powerful in terms of hardware or processor and it reads the English books for you.SummaryIf you read a lot, portability and battery life are important for you, forget about Nook Color. If you are a casual reader, looking for a fun device and distractions (Internet, Games, etc) Nook color will fit your bill. Just keep in mind that Nook Color is not a true ereader though, but more like a tablet with reading abilities; if you are aware of that and eye strain is not a concern, this can be a great buy.For now, I will pass. My Kindle 3 is simpler and lighter and does very good what it suppose to do: let me read (or read for me) my favorite books. Most novels and technical books are not in color so I don't need a tablet with Internet access to enjoy them, why bother then?",2011-01-07,ADE5RJ2I12LZ6,Jose,Good for casual reading.

411,1400532655,"[383, 393]",5.0,"Last year my husband asked me if I wanted a Kindle, because I love to read all the time and I try to be eco-friendly when possible.  I was intrigued, but my biggest weakness is magazines and I didn't like the availability or look of them on the Kindle.  When the iPad came out, I was blown away by the beauty of it, but felt like for a few dollars more I could just get a whole new laptop and it would be almost the same size.  For travel, the iPad seemed to big and fragile for me; I need to be able to jam all my toys into my backpack and not worry about them.When I stumbled onto the Nook Color, I absolutely flipped my wig and couldn't wait to get one!  Full color magazines, that look just like they do on the newsstand!  This could single-handedly save the rain forests - I seriously buy a LOT of magazines.  I also save them forever because you never know when you might want that one article or photo again, which drives my husband crazy.  So perhaps the Nook Color can save my marriage as well!  That's a lot of expectation to put on this adorable little device, but I think it's up to the challenge.Santa decided to come early to our house, so I just started playing with the NC a few days ago, and it is my first e-reader.  It was almost fully charged right out of the box, so I was able to start playing with it in less than an hour (it says you can use it while it is plugged in, but they keypad is VERY oversensitive when plugged in so I don't recommend it).  It easily connected to my home wifi and linked to the Barnes & Noble account I had set up earlier that day.  If you don't have home wifi, you might have to visit a public wifi location in order to activate it.  I recommend setting up a B&N; account beforehand if you intend to purchase anything from there, as it makes the first-time Nook use very smooth and enjoyable.BOOKS: There are many many books available from a variety of online sources, check the product details for formats (please note it does NOT support Kindle format).  I understand it's also easy to download books from your local public library, though I haven't tried that yet.  The B&N; Shop function within the Nook itself is the easiest interface but certainly not the only option.  While reading, it's very easy to adjust the font, screen brightness, and more to make it as comfortable as possible on the eyes.  At night I turn the brightness all the way down and find it very comfortable for my eyes while reading in bed.  I've read for hours on end without any sort of headache.  I haven't used the highlight, look-up, or share functions very much yet, but they're super easy to incorporate if you enjoy that sort of thing.  Page turning is an intuitive flip of the finger, or you can tap the side of the screen to move forward or back.CHILDREN'S BOOKS: The color on these looks amazing, and the ""read to me"" feature is wonderful for little ones learning to read on their own.  I imagine this would be great fun for a kid stuck in the back seat of a car for a long trip too!  There aren't a ton of Read to Me books available yet but they are adding more every week.  I don't even have kids but these are pretty awesome.MAGAZINES: Obviously this was a major feature for me!  The appearance of the magazines is absolutely gorgeous, the text and photos are clear and sharp.  You can use the ""finger pinch"" method on the touchscreen to zoom in and out, or you can use the ""Article View"" feature to pull out just the text of each page at a pleasant reading size.  The magazine includes every single page that you'd find on the newsstand, including advertisements, which to me is a benefit because I sometimes enjoy the photography and trends those provide.  Magazines can be read in portrait or landscape format, and you can flip through thumbnails at the bottom of the page to reach a particular article.  Most of the currently available magazines offer a single-issue purchase or a 14-day free trial, then bill you monthly for as long as you want to receive issues.  Subscriptions are very easy to manage so canceling is not complicated.  So far there are about 80 magazines available, and the number seems to be increasing regularly.NEWSPAPERS and PDF's: I haven't tried these yet, though some have reported formatting that make certain ones difficult to read.  The ones purchased directly through the Nook store are more likely to be formatted appropriately for the device and easier to read.  Better PDF support is likely to come in a future firmware update, though a lot of it depends on how the original publisher sets up the file.INTERNET: You do need a wifi connection to go online; 3G is unlikely to be available for the Nook Color unless you also purchase an accompanying data plan.  So far most web pages look crisp and beautiful, but are not as fully functional as on a laptop or computer.  Flash functionality is not available yet (but is planned) and a lot of people are experiencing difficulty with email and other text box typing.  I believe this will be fixed very soon, but for now the web is more of a ""read-only"" experience.MUSIC: You can load your own music or use the included Pandora app to link to your Pandora account.  The speaker isn't great so headphones would come in handy.  I'm extremely in love with my new iPod Nano so I will probably strap that on while reading rather than use this feature.VIDEO: Our first try produced some choppy playback, but I think the processor was very busy setting up the hardware because we had just gotten it out of the box.  After that, it played everything perfectly with jaw-dropping video quality!  It will play videos in MP4 format, so get yourself a converter and a microSD card and load it up for your next trip!  Apparently videos can also be side-loaded through the mini-USB cord.  I've only tried it on the card; it reads directly from the card with no problems.OTHER: You can add your own photos to use as background, or just to show friends.  It comes pre-loaded with a few games (sudoku, crossword, and chess) which work well and are fun.  ""Lend Me"" is an exclusive feature that allows you to swap books with other Nook users, and you can find groups of folks online who will swap with you if none of your friends have a Nook.  It uses the android operating system, and an app store is scheduled to open sometime in early 2011 so there will be much much more available in the coming months.I'm the type of person who doesn't need my phone to be a camera, my iPod to be a dvd player, or my e-reader to be a laptop.  The Nook Color does a WONDERFUL job as an e-reader of not only books, but also magazines and newspapers, and it has some other fun bells and whistles.  It does what it's supposed to do very well and the additional features make it a great value for the price.  I would give it a million stars if I could!",2010-12-07,AQMUXDDCLJSSV,J.

412,1400532655,"[7, 8]",4.0,"I agree with the other positive reviews. The color nook is an excellent reading machine, much better than either the Kindle or the e-ink B&W nook. Using the color Nook is totally intuitive with only a few positive surprises at some unexpected capabilities. The battery life is around 8 hours, so you will need to have your special recharging cord, which comecolor s with the Nook, handy. There are small imperfections in the Nook operating system that will get corrected as Barnes and Noble releases updates. The same was true with the Kindle and B&W Nook when first released. The key to a good reading experience with the color Nook is to turn the brightness down, way down. That way eye fatigue is minimal, similar to the e-ink B&W readers with similar brightness. Even with the brightness down, the contrast is excellent and the letters clear. When browsing the web, you might want to turn the brightness up a bit to beautifully display all those colors. The web browser is excellent. It works for email, especially Google mail.  The trick with the power limitations is to keep the brightness down when using the Nook as a reader and turn the internet off. Only turn the internet on when browsing or shopping. That way, when you put it down at night, the power level will be the same in the morning as it was when you went to sleep. Costing only $249 (Dec 2010) at Barnes and Noble, it's affordable and useful, especially if you travel.  The minus 1 star is for the few little glitches in the 1.0 operating system (based on Android 2.2), for the 8 hour battery life, and for the current lack of Apps. For what it is supposed to do, it does it well; it's better than an i-Pad (smaller, lighter, and far less costly).

415,1400532655,"[5, 5]",4.0,"I should preface this review by stating that I'm predisposed to liking tech gadgets that are a bit geeky, but do appreciate good industrial and UI design.The NC is really a great color eReader that also happens to have the makings of a terrific, Android based tablet.  BN literally buries the Android OS under a very thick custom UI and turns off many Android features.  This thick customized layer is what make the NC a great eReader, but a not so great a tablet. So while it is locked down, it does what its meant to do very well.One CAN get to non-BN eBooks in either the ePub or Adobe PDF format. Either format works, looks, and reads very well, easily as good as the best the market has to offer in terms of an eBook reading app.  The fact that BN chooses to bury the location of the downloaded non-BN content AND prevents one from creating shortcuts to either the book file or folder, placing said free books on the book shelf, or even listing them in your list of books is an annoyance to the tolerant and tech savvy.  To non-techies and those less tolerant of mucking about with a gadget, e.g., Grandma, it'd be a showstopper.  But then again, would such a user even KNOW how to get to free eBooks?Movies, again well-hidden in the file system, look great, but BN has capped the max resolution below the abilities of the screen AND the stock player is finicky about format.  For instance, my ripped for iPod Touch movies play fine.  My ripped for Droid Incredible movies aren't playable.  This despite both are MV4 files with AAC soundtracks.  The latter are higher resolution and bit rate so that's the issue.  Again, annoying, but not a real problem.The web browser is just fine.  Pretty much a stock Android browser so fast enough, compatible enough messing around, but if I were going to really do some research, I'd use my computer.With Android 2.2 coming in January, and a BN 'approved' Android market, it'll be an amazingly capable tablet for the money.And that is what one has to remember, it's an exceptional value given the hardware (fast processor/GPU combination, GREAT IPS LCD screen with better color/resolution then an iPad), 512MB RAM, expandable storage, great build quality), and has the best eReader app bar none.  Once Android 2.2 is added with some access to at least a few other apps like email, better browser, and a more format flexible music/video player the value will be simply unassailable...at the price.Pros:Great screen - overall looks, color quality, text quality, adjustabilityeReader UIMagazine format is excellentNewspaper and magazine subscriptions are month to monthBuild qualityIndustrial design - it actually sit flat on a table unlike the iWobleMicroSD supportForm factor - fits MANY of the now discontinued or about to be discontinued Amazon Kindle 2 cases!Battery life (for such a lightweight LCD based device in its size range)Full Android experience just a hack awayUnderlying processor/GPU/RAM is quite powerful though not tops, but more then capable of moving to Android 2.2 and possibly even GingerbreadCan read library eBooks if your local library carries themCons:THICK BN UI if you really want the tablet partsUI takes a few minutes to learnBluetooth not enabled (though it may be Bluetooth ready)No microphone (and therefore no Skype down the road unless the headphone jack can be used like early generation iPod Touches)Will need to hack if the BN Nook Market does not have what you want in terms of appsBN prices their books too highBN magazine subscriptions can be high, though some are a good valueNo camerasRecommended to the magazine/newspaper reader especially.

416,1400532655,"[18, 18]",4.0,"First off, for those of you buying this product expecting the e-ink experience, you are wrong.  This isn't an e-ink screen, if that is what you are looking for, go with (a) the original nook, (b) the kindle, or (c) any of the other e-ink dedicated e-readers on the market.This iteration of the nook is marketed towards certain select categories of readers:-The Magazine reader-Students with text books that have graphics-Childrens' books with lots of pictures-Comic book readersIf you notice, these are categories of readers that benefit from the ability of the reader to handle color graphics, which is something e-ink can't yet do!PRICEFor the price, you are getting an android tablet with limited functionality, though, with some technical knowledge, it is possible to unlock this device to be able to fully take advantage of the android market (though it may void your warranty, so do it at your own risk).  Similarly sized android tablets go for prices starting at double the price of the nook color, but they come with full functionality.  Another device this has been compared to is the iPad- which runs at about twice the price as well for the very base model.  On the price point, you are definitely getting a decent deal, though, you are sacrificing some of the functionality for the the reduced cost.Also note, you are not getting 3G access or any other cellular service to access the market- unlike the original nook, that came with the free mobile access to be able to make purchases from the nook market on the go.  The likely reason for the lack of mobile access is due to the fact that this device runs a lot faster and features a full web browser- this increases the speed and easy of the user to access web content- which would be undesirable to any phone service that hosts access because it would reduce the service that their paying customers get.  Instead of mobile data service, users have the option of accessing the BN market and the full internet through wireless.  With today's cell phone technology, many phones are able to be set up as wireless hotspots that users can use to get access on the go- when they are away from their home network.  Overall, this isn't a big deal to me, but I am sure some original nook users depend on that free mobile service to get access to the BN market, so this would be a draw back for you for sure.WEIGHTHonestly, this device does run a little on the heavy side, however, I do believe that it is slightly lighter than it's predecessor.  Still, for the e-reader market, it is heavy.  For the tablet market, it is a little more reasonable.  The weight is a sacrifice, but as long as you aren't trying to read while laying on your back, you should be ok.USER FRIENDLINESS AND EXTRA FEATURESI find this device to be quite simple almost immediately.  Every function that I have looked for has been where I expect it to be and everything has worked smoothly for me.  The page controls while you read work great, and I love that they now give you the option to tap to turn the page rather than having to swipe like you did with the last version of the nook.The full web is pretty easy to use once you get used to typing on a touch screen keyboard (which is always annoying).This device also integrates with your facebook, twitter, and google accounts.  This is great for the avid readers that want to be plugged into their social media.Another feature that is nice to have on the reader is Pandora- it is a nice added bonus to have internet radio available on the reader.One thing I wish this device had was access to android market, but I guess you can't have everything.OVERALLI like this tablet.  I think it was a good buy and I would buy another one if this one broke.  For the price, you are getting an underpowered tablet, but it still has access to the full internet- which you can use multiple windows in.  It is primarily a reader, which makes me wish it were as easy on the eyes as e-ink, but for the market it is being geared towards, you can't really complain about that!",2011-02-21,A3IWSCI3KCL041,Kat,Excellent value for what it is- a reader with an LCD,1298246400.0,1.0,2011,2,4040.0,52,first buying product expecting e ink experience wrong e ink screen looking go original nook b kindle c e ink dedicated e reader market iteration nook marketed towards certain select category reader magazine reader student text book graphic childrens book lot picture comic book readersif notice category reader benefit ability reader handle color graphic something e ink yet pricefor price getting android tablet limited functionality though technical knowledge possible unlock device able fully take advantage android market though may void warranty risk similarly sized android tablet go price starting double price nook color come full functionality another device compared ipad run twice price well base model price point definitely getting decent deal though sacrificing functionality reduced cost also note getting g access cellular service access market unlike original nook came free mobile access able make purchase nook market go likely reason lack mobile access due fact device run lot faster feature full web browser increase speed easy user access web content would undesirable phone service host access would reduce service paying customer get instead mobile data service user option accessing bn market full internet wireless today cell phone technology many phone able set wireless hotspot user use get access go away home network overall big deal sure original nook user depend free mobile service get access bn market would draw back sure weighthonestly device run little heavy side however believe slightly lighter predecessor still e reader market heavy tablet market little reasonable weight sacrifice long trying read laying back ok user friendliness extra featuresi find device quite simple almost immediately every function looked expect everything worked smoothly page control read work great love give option tap turn page rather swipe like last version nook full web pretty easy use get used typing touch screen keyboard always annoying device also integrates facebook twitter google account great avid reader want plugged social medium another feature nice reader pandora nice added bonus internet radio available reader one thing wish device access android market guess everything overalli like tablet think good buy would buy another one one broke price getting underpowered tablet still access full internet use multiple window primarily reader make wish easy eye e ink market geared towards really complain,excellent value reader lcd

Screen is gorgeous. I think if they skipped hard metal and went for carbon metal or good plastic it probably would have shed few ounces in weight and would have felt lighter to hold for long time. That is no deal breaker though as the 7"" size is perfect to hold for long time unlike other tablets that are way too big to hold with single hand for reading.Tried couple of kids books for my daughter and the color screen makes the content look rich and attractive. Will soon be trying out periodicals and photography books. But my main intention of owning it is for tablet and I would recommend it.

The battery doesn't last long enough for you be connected to the internet too often anyway. There is no cool page turning animation like on an ipad, it just changes instantly to the next page, which is still a great feature on this item. It's not so great as a tablet though. The internet browser is great, but there is no flash support (not for the ipad either though) and there are few apps. That is not important to me as I'm using this as an eReader and occasionally play the included games on it when I'm bored (sodoku, crossword, chess). I like that you can play music and listen to it in the background. When connected to the internet, the Pandora Radio app is nice to have in the background, though I've found it rather difficult to turn off when I'm done with it.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an eReader and doesn't care if they have to charge it back up every few days.",2011-04-24,A1WKUY7T0EM0GM,"Krystal James ""genie""","NookColor - Great eReader, Not So Great Tablet",1303603200.0,1.0,2011,4,2554.0,46,high point responsive touch screen touch screen easy eye even though back lit page turning fast instant seamless flashing delay favorite feature organized menu decent sound quality physical home screen button useful free ebook friday curtesy barnes noble elend technology local library offer service mine nice feature reason chose nook kindle kid book fun read internet browsing experience quite nice web page load quickly interface device beautiful great accessory available item great size fit easily hand back lit display nice need flashlight read dark easy book mark page playing game lot fun playing game original nook thanks touchscreen barnes noble ebook store quite nice easy browse screen keyboard also nicelower point battery life used internet lucky last day full charge internet still last day use everyday standby battery life device sleep mode pretty good though physical page turning button sometimes advance flip backwards accident weight deal breaker get used could lot lighter conclusion love love love nookcolor take everywhere go g option aware browse internet home anyway battery last long enough connected internet often anyway cool page turning animation like ipad change instantly next page still great feature item great tablet though internet browser great flash support ipad either though apps important using ereader occasionally play included game bored sodoku crossword chess like play music listen background connected internet pandora radio app nice background though found rather difficult turn done highly recommend anyone want ereader care charge back every day,nookcolor great ereader great tablet

431,1400532655,"[5, 5]",4.0,"I went into the tablet market for two reasons: (1) I read mostly inside in the evenings and was tired of needing a book light for the e-ink reader and (2) I wanted to consolidate my travel electronics from phone + ereader + notebook.  The prices of straight tablets were outrageous to me when my primary purpose was to eliminate taking the laptop along to be able to review email and do moderate web browsing on a decent sized screen (the phone was way too small).  After reading several reviews and recommendations, I settled on a used Nook Color for both price and performance.  I have not been disappointed.  I have rooted my device for a full blown Android experience and a far superior web browser but rooting is not needed for the basics. I'm just someone who likes to tinker.Everyone needs to understand, this is an e-reader first and a tablet second even when rooted.  At $200, you cannot expect what you would get with a $500-$600 device.  But, it does what it is intended to do quite well.  At 7 inches the screen is comparable size to most e-readers and that was important to me for portability.  I simply swapped the e-ink reader for the Nook Color and it still fit perfectly in my purse.  The Nook Color is also really good for reviewing emails and smooth web browsing.  My rooted device has an overclocked processor so I have no problems with speed.  It's perfect for quickly reaching out to the web to check the latest news, weather, etc. and then get right back to reading my books.  I haven't had many problems running other Android tablet applications and have found that the problems I have had seem to be common problems with the applications themselves.If you want a premium e-reader, this is a super nice product at a great price.  If you're looking for a budget tablet without all of the bells and whistles (camera, gps, microphone) but that will handle the basics of email, web browsing, Netflix, Hulu Plus, and other consumption tasks, this is more than adequate and enjoys much more favorable reviews than similarly priced tablets (with the exceptions of the Kindle Fire and its own successor the Nook Tablet).  The bottom line with this little marvel is to keep your expectations in line with what you're paying for and what you're not paying for. If you expect a $200 version of the standard bearer (i.e IPad), then you'll be very happy.  If, however, you're expecting a $200 equivalent, then look elsewhere.",2011-12-22,A13OA6RAGTF183,"M.

Then one day it stopped working so he called customer service and was transferred to some foreign country where the woman could not speak English well,  so he asked to speak to another. Next a man came on who spoke worse that the woman so he asked if there was another person. When talking to the next person he was rude so he  asked customer service if he  could sent it in for repair.

He said he  sent a number of Emails and they didn't  respond or when they did they say read the manual.

433,1400532655,"[0, 0]",4.0,"I was looking for a e-reader for our 13 year old's birthday this past October.  After researching the popular e-readers i.e. the Kindle Fire, I went with the Nook Color for one simple reason; the ability to Root it and turn it into an Android tablet, for a lot less! (It also takes a macroSD card). While you can find the Kindle rooted too, I found the Nook Color rooted was more readily available and more affordable. Since I was purchasing for a teen I  did not want to get a new or more expensive model.We purchased one that was already rooted to cyanogenmod 7.  You can also purchase an macro SD card here or on Ebay that is rooted for you if you already own a Nook Color.We connected it to our home wi-fi and Viola, she can do everything i.e. text free, download games and unlimited apps from the Market. The rooted Nook Color can do everything a tablet can do except for make or receive phone/video calls.Note, all rooted Nook Colors are not the same version.  We purchased one for our son for this Christmas and I did not notice it was not cyanogenmod 7.  This is relevant as it did not possess full access to all of the apps on the Google Play (or Android market) as our daughter's does.  You can update the Root software and I did that but I did not notice a change in its ability to download the other apps. But honestly, I was tired at that point and gave it to our son on Christmas as it was good otherwise and I doubt he would notice.

I have a Kindle DX but it has trouble with many of the tabletop RPG PDFs I throw at it and the 4GB is a tad small to hold my 14GB collection. The built-in PDF reader is worthless, slow to open files the Kindle DX had no trouble with and wouldn't even turn pages. I jail broke it, install a mostly vanilla image of Froyo and installed Adobe Acrobat and from there it shined. Page turning and navigation was a breeze and it complimented (read not-replaced) the Kindle DX quite well.It's a tad small for anything more in-depth than book reading and Angry Birds.

438,1400532655,"[7, 7]",5.0,"A syndicated consumer advocate has a saying: ""I am willing to pay less for less.""  So am I.  I actually bought the Nook Color (NC) more for its tablet features than its e-book features.  I considered several tablets for at least double the price, but when the new Android OS was released for the NC, I decided to try it out.  I personally have not been disappointed.Here is what it doesn't have: camera, USB accessory support, fast processor, robust app forum, 3G model, and long battery life.  But as I said I am willing to pay less for less.  I primarily wanted it for basic web browsing (with Flash capability), movie playback, e-mail capability, and e-book capability.My experience has been great so far - I have had my NC for about six weeks.  I personally have had no problem with the web browser and it has met all of my needs.  Movie viewing has been fine and I have had no problems viewing them.  I use Handbrake to convert movies/videos to a format for the NC, and it works great.  I have several e-mail accounts I use for personal and business purposes, and the POP3 support the NC offers is perfect.  I am no longer tied to my PC, laptop, or confined to the small screen of a mobile phone.  As for the e-book reader, it's great as should be expected (My 8 year old daughter actually uses it for reading more than me.  I download books from the library for her, and she loves it.)  The notation, highlighting, and other reading tools are fine and it also has several options to customize the font and background color as well as the font size.Other reviewers have commented about crashes, but I have not had a single crash yet.  And I also don't think the stock Android OS is bad at all, but with this being my first experience with a tablet and Android OS, my expectations may have been lower than normal.

The screen is very sharp and easy to read.  Magazines look awesome on the Nook Color and it's so much more convenient than having a stack of magazines clutter up the house.

443,1400532655,"[12, 12]",5.0,"I was instantly the hero for my wife this Christmas, when I surprised her with a nook color under the tree. The device has great aesthetics, with a 7 inch IPS LCD display that is one of the most pleasing I've ever laid my eyes on, a thin and sleek profile, wonderful packaging, and nice support from Barnes and Noble, but that as Paul Harvey would say is only the beginning, this review is about the rest of the story.  At first glance this appears like just another eReader, but with a color screen for magazines and children's books swapped in for the normal eInk, but there is something different lurking beneath.  This device runs android 2.1 under the hood, heavily modified as it may be out of the box, and with that choice of operating system comes a potential access a world of hackery that is well beyond the reach of any other eReader.  In order to access this world you need to be willing to educate yourself a bit and root this device.  The process is actually quite simple (go to XDA-Developers forums or nookdevs.com Nook Color portal to read about it), and despite the dire warning disclaimers quite foolproof, and fully reversible (just in case you need warranty service).Once rooted, the device gains access to android market, where you can get thousands of apps, games, and tools for free (legally), or for a small purchase price.  Compared to the currently empty nook app store, the android market is bursting with exciting activity.  A rooted nook color gets access to the kindle app, so you can basically read all your amazon purchases on this device too.  Sony Reader app is coming soon from what I've heard, so you are probably going to get support for that store too.  Tied to the Kobo ecosystem, to borrow a phrase, there is an app for that.  Emulators for old game consoles are working nicely.  Playing Angry Birds on a 7 inch tablet is so much more fun than on a tiny 4 inch phone.  Stock browser lacks pinch to zoom, download Dolphin HD, and there you go.  Can't put app shortcuts and widgets on the home screen, home switcher and one of the freeware launchers (ADW is pretty nice) got your back.  A rooted nook color becomes something of a worthy competitor to the much more expensive iPad and Galaxy Tab.  Unlike real android phones and tablets, this does lack the physical menu, back, and search buttons, but a software softkey is installed upon rooting, so there are functional on-screen virtual equivalents to do the job.Don't get me wrong, there are some things that won't work, as nook color lacks a 3G radio, camera, or GPS.  The ROM is also a heavily modified version, so some abilities have been stripped out, and won't be available until a true custom ROM is available.  But more apps a likely to work than not due to a capable processor, ample storage packed underneath, and most importantly a talented and dedicated hacking community willing to experiment with their device and then educate others.  This is still early in the development life cycle of the nook color, so their are some rough edges to the process, some things will require resorting to the command line to fix.

My goal was to be able to carry a few books around for pleasure, maybe even some business documents.  Even though I have an iPhone, I thought I would diversify and go after an Android based platform.  I figured that even if I decided to go with the iPad eventually I could use the Nook app on the iPad to read the books that I've bought.After a few weeks of using it, I'm close to handing it over to the kids or jailbreaking it for experimentation with Android, and getting an iPad.1) The quality is low.  The software is buggy, ironically one of the buggiest parts is trying to buy a book, where it more often than not hangs after a purchase with the download in limbo.  The battery charge socket seems to be flakey, so that often the unit gets confused about whether it is charging or now.2) Can't buy books when you're outside the US.  So, on an international business trip - when it'd be nice to pick up a few books for the plane or to pass time in a cafe - one can't buy a book.  That sucks.3) Although in theory I could load a bunch of PDF documents onto it for reading, the display is too small for them.  The interface for PDF documents, in terms of adjusting fonts, scrolling, is very limited.  Device is useless for this.4) The book selection is slim.  I don't think my tastes are that obscure, but I'm not interested in the mass market.  Forget pulling out old sci fi classics.  Forget getting a textbook.  And I find that some of the books that I would like to read are available for the Kindle but not the Nook.5) The iPhone Nook app is super buggy.  In theory it should let me sync, get my books on the iPhone too.  But the iPhone app just hangs and doesn't sync to my account, even after a reinstall.  If you read the reviews of the Nook app on the app store, they're all saying this.6) The App selection is slim.

448,1400532655,"[7, 7]",5.0,"I've owned the Sony PRS-500, Kindle 1, 2 & 3, Sony PRS-350SC and the Nook Color. Each one has advantages, but none more than the B&N; Nook Color. Hold the Nook in your hand and you hold a reader, tablet PC, MP3 player, and photo viewer. It seems like it should be a work-out, but no so. With an optional leather cover (many cool choices at B&N;'s site) it weighs in at about a pound. Heavier than the Kindle? Sure, but also does so much more.The features that make this a stand-out are the 7"" color touch screen, full keyboard, and Android-based browser. The browser is a MAC, so Flash video is not supported, but all others are. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, email and everything else appears just as it does on your PC. Page turns are an effortless swipe on the screen.Two things I consider drawbacks are, first and foremost, the battery life. Don't expect more than 7 or 8 hours. B&N; says 10 days, but that's in hibernation mode. That drawback is kind of big. I'm forever charging the Nook, and charge time is 4-5 hours. The other drawback is backlighting, which is unfortunate but necessary for the brilliant color screen. Adust the page color in ""Settings"" and reduce the eye-strain.Aside from the battery life, the Nook Color is the best thing going out there.

451,1400532655,"[3, 3]",3.0,"Not quite a full-fledged tablet, not a dedicated e-reader...and that's OK with me for $249!  I had my first two NookColors replaced, the first due to a SD card holder spring that failed after 90 days and the second due to an unresponsive touch screen and problems with powering on.  Customer service had me on the phone for about 45 minutes and took me through two factory re-sets before I finally convinced them to replace my second unit.  Note that all replacements of defective devices are re-furbished, not new.  Finally, I am experiencing what Barnes & Noble had in mind.  NookColor #3 works great and now that I have a unit with a touch screen that works as it should I am finally realizing what a great little machine this can be, with a really solid e-reader and nice add's like Pandora and other apps, as well as wi-fi web browsing that really works well for a function that is secondary to the NookColor's primary role as an e-reader.  I really appreciate being able to listen to any selection from my iTunes library straight off the SD Card while reading or surfing the web or playing around with a couple of the apps I bought. Standard quality MP4 video files play smoothly, and most were converted to that format via third party software on my PC (My VideoConverter). The app store is still under-developed and I really wish this had 3G capability so I'd have an excuse for taking it with me more often, but at such a low price compared to 3G tablets, I have become very enamored of this machine.  The questionable quality control, a screen that is reflective in bright light and the weight of the device with cover are my only complaints, and if I had not encountered the quality problems I mentioned this would have been a solid 4- or 5-Star review, especially considering the price vs. competing tablets (because it really is in the tablet category, especially with Android 2.2 froyo installed).",2011-06-28,A1R1B3C8CFK4CZ,S.

454,1400532655,"[23, 25]",1.0,"I think that all international customers should be forewarned that Barnes and Noble prevents you from being able to purchase any books online from their bookstore, you will be sent emails stating that books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States. This is all despite having an international credit card accepted all over the United States (even by Barnes & Noble themselves as this is the same card that I used to pay for my B&N; membership) and despite even giving them my US postal and physical address where all of my packages would be signed for  by a real person.The thing that angers me the most is that I explained to Barnes & Noble (via phone) that I live in Trinidad and they said that it would not be a problem for me to purchase books, but after purchasing a Nook color plus additional items such as screen protectors, a leather case and a 32 gig Sandisk memory card (all bought on Amazon), I have not been able to purchase a single book.If International Customers are not welcome, there should at least be some type of warning on their website. I feel like I was ripped-off by Barnes & Noble, and the sad thing about it is that I bought it all as a birthday gift for my wife. Shame on Barnes & Noble, that sales rep lied to me just to make a sale, my money was good enough for them but I am not good enough for their product. Now I have this New Nook color with all of these extras just gathering dust.It is sad to see just how low some companies will stoop to make a dollar.The real slap in the face is that after registering the nook on the Barnes & Noble website for the purpose of purchasing books, they have no problem sending me offers week after week to purchase even more of their products but as far as I am concerned, they have lost this customer permanently.P.S. This review has nothing whatsoever to do with Amazon.com, my gripe is with Barnes & Noble for giving false information to secure a sale and caring nothing about International Customers.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)In the interest of fairness to Barnes & Noble and giving you Amazon.com community 100% reliable information I decided to open an account with a bank that's based in the USA to see if B&N; would be able to access the funds from that account, I'm trying to find out whether it's a location issue or just a payment issue so we can all know for sure.I decided to try this little experiment because I just can't understand how I can gain access to sample books from B&N; but every time I try to purchase one there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).I now have a Bank Of America Visa Debit Card which I have not tried as yet, it is possible that the issue with Barnes & Noble is that they cannot access funds from my Scotia Master Card which is based in Trinidad so I will give the Bank Of America card a try seeing that it's based in the USA and if that does not work then the last resort will be to try using my Pay Pal account. I'll post an update as to whether it worked or not.(UPDATE  UPDATE  UPDATE)I'm sorry for taking so long but anyway, let us get on with it.  As I said before, every time I tried to purchase a book there seems to be a problem, what makes this whole thing even more confusing is the e-mail that was sent by B&N; after I tried to purchase a Book via my Scotia Master Card (books can only be sold to customers ""physically"" residing in the United States).Well I found out that IT IS POSSIBLE to purchase books on the Nook once you are using a US based card. I was not able to purchase books using my Scotia Master Card but I had no problem whatsoever when using my Bank of America Visa Card, so it definitely has nothing to do with our geographical location, or IP address. The only issue that I see here is the fact that not everyone has access to a US Bank Card but you may still have a chance with making purchases via PayPal.I have noticed that there are some US based sellers that have problems accessing funds from Trinidad based Credit Cards, some even have problems accessing funds from US based Cards although they are also in the US themselves, in cases like this I've found that the best payment method to avoid any headaches is via PayPal.

Our county library lends out e readers for patrons to try so I got on the list and after three months it was my turn to try the Kindle Color Nook. It doesn't overwhelmingly impress me though the color and clarity of the screen is as good as Our Kindle Fire's. Text on the screen is clear and turning the pages is easy. ONE advantage the Nook has over the Fire is that it shows page numbers instead of the Fire's percent of book read. Mrs. Spudman would prefer to have page numbers but has adapted to the percents.My wife and I are both comfortable navigating the Fire and barely had to refer to the owner's e manual. I don't like moving around on the Nook, and that may be solely because I'd become used to the ease of the Fire. Trying to surf the web on the Nook was very frustrating, and watching movies or video clips on the Nook was an ordeal with herky jerky motion, slow responses, and freezes. We watch free TV shows on the Kindle Fire with smooth enjoyment.The Fire was a gift to my wife from me. She loves it. If I were to buy a small device for reading, I'd prefer to  buy a tablet and download a reading program on it that enables book downloads. That method may preclude the ability to get free books (it does on the Kindle), but it's a circumstance I'd accept.In summary, the Color Nook is pretty good as a reader.

What that content is remains a mystery to me and you cannot fix the error until you connect to wifi, after which it miraculously fixes itself.All in all this may be usable like a really slow laptop around the house, but for traveling its not worth lugging around.

The Nook makes it easy to chose a font style, a font size, single spacing or double spacing...you can customize the appearance of the text to your needs.It is easy to read the Nook indoors with any decent room lighting, and easy to read outdoors in the shade.  It is July in Texas...so I have not tried using it in direct sunlight.The Nook is easy and comfortable to hold in one hand for extended periods of time.  Turning pages is easy with a light touch on the side of the screen or a press of the page button in the sideframe.The battery took a couple of full charge/discharge cycles to stabilize. At that point, it was using about 2% of the battery for each hour or two of reading.  Reading an hour or two hours a day and using the Wi-Fi an hour or two per week would result in 3 weeks or 4 weeks per charge.  In contrast, my color e-reader requires charging each day.Magazines look MUCH better on my color e-reader, but magazine text is very readable on the Nook.  The Nooks is at its best with a book with plain text, as illustrations, art, drawings, etc. look crude compared with a color e-reader.I have several books in paperback at home that I also have on the Nook.  Because I can increase font size and use double-spacing on the Nook, it is much easier to read on the Nook than in the paperback book.  My aging eyes feel much better after a couple hours with the Nook than after a couple hours straining to read the ""fine print"" that is typical of lower priced paperback books.If you want an e-reader primarily for magazines, you probably should buy the Nook Color or a small color tablet.

Holding the device was also pleasant and the page turn buttons were a great addition that the Kindle touch desperately lacks. Hardware and software wise, the product itself is perfect as a functional and easy to use e-Reader.However, when I started to look for books to purchase (they were about investing if you were curious), out of the five books I tried to find, I ended up only being able to find one of the books I wanted. I purchased this device having read half a dozen reviews, and the reviewers all commented on how comparable the book selections for Amazon and Barnes and Noble are, but the truth is, B&N; still has a ways to go.I am aware the the Nook supports e-pub which allows it to read generic pdf files (something that the Kindle can't do), but one of the features I look for in e-readers is convenience. Having to buy a book from Google books on my laptop and then transferring it to my Nook is not convenient.

The default software is not compatible with many would-be useful formats such as txt or rtf. There is no folder view for displaying the books you put on it, you are constrained to a library view that tries to sort everything for you. The settings page is a joke, there is almost no customization to be had there. The shop's main view was nonfunctional out of the box; every time I tried to access it, it kicked me back out to the main page, and I had to access it by going to the ""top 100"" page instead, and even then the search would sometimes not work.

477,140053271X,"[5, 11]",1.0,"Here's my take on NST:  This is a very nice, but very limited reader.  I LOVE THE DISPLAY.  That's it.  A real home run?  Not quite...Quick summary is that they won't sell me any other unit with an LCD (I spend all day looking at one of those, I don't want another one for my fun-reading).  I might as well use my netbook or go all the way to a real tablet, and that won't be from B+N.Here are the problems with the whole Nook thing.(1) You can't use it for a PDF, magazine, or anything with graphics because YOU CANNOT ZOOM OR ROTATE. I have purchased some books with pictures and figures that you can't see.  Guess they want you to get the color tablet-like Nook, huh?  Nope, not going there (see above).(2) YOU CANNOT SHARE BOOKS. Yeah, yeah, they SAY you can, but that's VERY LIMITED and makes no sense.  (If the publishers trust them enough with their DRM to have the book at all, why can't you transfer the book to someone else using the same DRM?) I can get a paperback, read it, and share it forever.  Not so with Nook and you know it.(3) B+N (and everybody's) E-BOOKS COST THE SAME AS A NEW PAPERBACK, even though the seller didn't incur any cost of printing, shipping, inventory, etc.  But I can get a paperback for 25% off at my local Kroger grocery store for new releases and best sellers, or I can go down to the used book stores and find quite a few titles at 50% (or more) off list.

481,140053271X,"[507, 525]",5.0,"I purchased the Kindle (Wi-Fi) and the original Nook (the B&W; one) and tried them out during the return period. While there were things about the Kindle I really liked (features that other reviewers on the Kindle site had written), the one thing that made me choose the Nook was the ability to borrow and read ebooks from my local library. Haven't been back to the library since!Now here comes the Nook Simple Touch Reader (Nook STR). I got one via pre-order when they came out in early June.  It has the same e-ink Pearl screen as the Kindle, so the screen contrast is no longer an issue. And wow, has the user interface improved over the original Nook! (which I thought was clunky) The entire e-ink Pearl screen has full touchscreen capability. On both the Kindle and the original Nook, I felt myself wanting to touch the screen to select a book to read, instead of using the buttons (on the Kindle) or the LCD touchscreen (on the original Nook) to highlight and select the desired ebook. On the Nook STR, the Library screen shows icons for all the ebooks loaded in the device (both library and purchased). Touch the icon, and the ebook opens. Turning the page? Touch the screen on the right side of the page (to go forward) or the left side (to go back). Or swipe your finger across the screen as in flipping a physical book page. Or use the buttons built into the frame. Want to page quickly through a book? Hold down the page turning button. Need a word definition? Touch and hold on the word and a dictionary pops up. The user interface resembles that of an iPhone or iPad, with the icons, virtual keyboard and the physical home button. It even has the ""slide to unlock"" feature like the iPhone. The touchscreen on the Nook STR is infrared (it senses the heat of your finger, again like iPhone), so a light touch works just fine. I found that on the original Nook, sometimes it would take multiple touches on the LCD screen for the device to recognize a command.In response to the reviews about the touchscreen ceasing to respond, the pre-order Nook STR I had suffered from that problem.  The touchscreen would become slow to respond, and eventually quit working altogether.  A power cycle generally brought it back.  I started a thread on B&N;'s website about this and found many others having the problem.  I did take my Nook STR back to B&N; and they exchanged it.  Have had the replacement Nook ST for six weeks now and the problem hasn't returned.  So don't be spooked about buying one due to this problem - if it happens to you, exchange it.Going back to library books, I had to install Adobe Digital Editions onto my PC (my library had the link to download - free).  This software allows you to manage your ebooks on your Nook.The Nook STR is a good choice for seniors that may not have extensive computer skills.  Using the device is easy enough, but loading books from a library website (via Adobe Digital Editions) requires a few steps to complete.  If help is needed, it can be a positive relationship-building experience.One last plus - once you get your Nook STR, check the ""Shop"" tab to access B&Ns; website.

489,140053271X,"[4, 6]",5.0,"First let me qualify my comments.  If you are looking for an all purpose ePad or IPAD alternative, buy another product!  That's clearly not what Barnes and Noble designed this unit for.  It's not intended to surf the web, check email, etc.  It is an eReader...PERIOD!Having said that, in my opinion, it is the best out there right now.  It is incredibly light weight - much lighter than even a typical paperback.  It is easy on the eyes for extended reading periods and can be read in basically every lighting situation you could read a real book.  The clarity is sharp but not overpowering on the eyes like an LCD type display is after a few hours.The battery life is insane.  If you turn off WIFI, which should be normal unless you are looking for another book, the battery doesn't need recharging for weeks on end.  Page turning is a simple touch to the left or right of the screen.  Assignable buttons are also provided for pagination but they require a rather firm press.  I found most of the time I don't use them.It has a very responsive touch screen for all your navigation.  I had a 1st generation Nook and this one is far easier to navigate through books which is a big plus for Bibles or Reference books.  It reads ePub format so more than half of what I read comes from the public library.It is not going to be great for color magazines and so on.  You will need a Nook Color or an ePad like Xoom or IPAD for that.  But the downside with those is that the LCD type display cannot be read in direct sunlight so good luck at the beach or pool.One nice feature I use now and then is the dictionary.

493,140053271X,"[5, 5]",5.0,"I have had my nook simple touch for a few weeks now- I previously owned a Sony Reader pocket edition, and I own a iPad. This device fills a niche- if you want to annotate pdf documents or watch movies or any of those other things, get a tablet or the iPad or the kindle fire. This device is designed to read books, and it does a beautiful job at it. I purchased my Sony reader expecting to be able to add comments in it, but it was way too difficult, and ultimately I decided to purchase an iPad. Like the Sony reader, the nook can take notes but wouldn't be a great device to purchase for that purpose.It was pretty easy to set up- I didn't read the instruction manual, but I usually don't. I just followed the on screen instructions to connect it with my internet, my barnes and noble account, and then plugged it into my computer to sync it with library books. I had a bit of trouble connecting it with my internet, but that has happened with every new device I've purchased, so I think its my internet's fault, not the nook. I went through the steps a few times and then it started worked.I really like holding it to read- I generally read ridiculously thick books, so its nice to have something small and light to hold instead of a massive book that I have to prop up (and its so much nicer to read from than an iPad- the iPad is fine to read from, and i never seemed to feel screen fatigue, but it is way too heavy to hold with one hand). Initially I didn't realize that the two buttons on either side of the screen move the page forward or back, so I was touching the screen each time- the delay time is a bit longer that way, and it was annoying to have to use both hands. As soon as I realized that the buttons existed, the experience got even better.The battery life seems great- I charged it all the way up using my usb-to-outlet power adapter that I have for my iphone/ipad, and it worked great. I haven't had to charge it again, and I've been reading for about an hour each day.The one thing that surprised me and was frustrating for a few minutes was when I realized that I couldn't load my other epub books onto the nook because there wasn't enough room. The advertised size of the nook is 2gb, which is a ton of books, but it wasn't enough room for the books I've acquired through other sources- like google book downloads. A quick google search solved this problem- barnes and noble appropriates the majority of this space for content you purchase directly from barnes and noble. Fortunately there is an easy solution- there is a slot for a microSD card, and I happened to have a 2gb one lying around- plus they only cost about $5, if that. I popped it in, turned the device off and on, and I was ready to go again. Not a deal-killer by any means, but something to consider if you're planning to add your own epub library to your nook.Kindle vs. Nook- I haven't owned a kindle, only used it for a few minutes, but my personal opinion as I decided which to purchase was this: price was important (and I got a great black friday deal on the nook), and since they were about the same price I wanted to support the more open epub format, since you can load books from other sources. Yes, its possible to convert epub to kindle format but its an extra step that many people won't be interested in. I would have purchased the kindle with special offers, and hadn't thought much about it, but I've enjoyed the pictures of authors that show up on my nook screen, and would probably get annoyed by the commercials/make a point to put my nook in a case so I didn't have to see them.Durability- I haven't abused it by any stretch of the imagination- yet- but it did take a fall off a coffee table and didn't crack/break/show any sort of damageI'll update my review as I have more time to play with it in the next few months",2011-12-09,A21623VNZ5H1YE,Emma L,Great purchase- you won't regret it,1323388800.0,1.0,2011,12,3829.0,35,nook simple touch week previously owned sony reader pocket edition ipad device fill niche want annotate pdf document watch movie thing get tablet ipad kindle fire device designed read book beautiful job purchased sony reader expecting able add comment way difficult ultimately decided purchase ipad like sony reader nook take note great device purchase purpose pretty easy set read instruction manual usually followed screen instruction connect internet barnes noble account plugged computer sync library book bit trouble connecting internet happened every new device purchased think internet fault nook went step time started worked really like holding read generally read ridiculously thick book nice something small light hold instead massive book prop much nicer read ipad ipad fine read never seemed feel screen fatigue way heavy hold one hand initially realize two button either side screen move page forward back touching screen time delay time bit longer way annoying use hand soon realized button existed experience got even better battery life seems great charged way using usb outlet power adapter iphone ipad worked great charge reading hour day one thing surprised frustrating minute realized load epub book onto nook enough room advertised size nook gb ton book enough room book acquired source like google book downloads quick google search solved problem barnes noble appropriates majority space content purchase directly barnes noble fortunately easy solution slot microsd card happened gb one lying around plus cost popped turned device ready go deal killer mean something consider planning add epub library nook kindle v nook owned kindle used minute personal opinion decided purchase price important got great black friday deal nook since price wanted support open epub format since load book source yes possible convert epub kindle format extra step many people interested would purchased kindle special offer thought much enjoyed picture author show nook screen would probably get annoyed commercial make point put nook case see durability abused stretch imagination yet take fall coffee table crack break show sort damagei update review time play next month,great purchase regret

Yes, the nook is quicker on the page turning and lighter but I am having too much trouble to appreciate faster and lighter.  I am having an infinite amount of trouble getting library books onto the nook - I've yet to succeed and the problems lie with adobe digital editions.  Why aren't nooks plug and play?  That's my first big problem.  I have no problem with my Sony and the library book I wanted is now on my Sony.  The second is that I like to read while I'm eating my lunch - ereader in left hand and fork in right.  It is not easy to change the page on the nook while eating - the bottom right corner is too far from my thumb and the bottom buttons are too high up the side.  The Sony has a set of buttons right in the bottom center, which is perfect placement.  I read the great reviews on the nook and for the price, I thought it was worth a try.  I'm also disappointed with the wifi registration requirement and wifi in general.  I don't need wifi on my ereader but it looks like they're all offering it now.  I also don't appreciate my registration info being used by B&N; as permission to start emailing me crap - I am already unsubscribed from that 'service'.  I'm definitely not happy with the nook and I'm going to save up my money to buy another Sony.**UPDATE 5/25/13**  I finally was able to download library books onto my nook but it was frustrating and time consuming; I finally found help online.

We returned it within 3 days.Next we tried the original Nook Black&White;, and interface was much better, but the screen had poor contrast.

503,140053271X,"[3, 3]",5.0,"This is the third ebook reader I've used and definitely the best.  The Franklin eBookman had nice hardware but dreadful firmware with more bugs than you would find in a swamp in summer.  The Ectaco Jetbook Lite had a number of glitches in its firmware as well, plus an extremely user-unfriendly upgrade method.I did encounter one major problem with this Nook Simple Touch -- the life of a battery charge was nowhere near the several weeks promised (with wifi off).  Fortunately, however, I called B&N; Customer Service, and they advised me to install the latest firmware, V1.0.1, which addresses the power issue.The upgrade proceeded easily and without glitches, and it seems to have solved the problem; though I haven't put the duration of a battery charge to the full test yet, the charge indicator is holding at 100% after a full day, including more than an hour of reading.  That compares very favorably to the 83% discharge rate I had been experiencing in just three days using the old firmware.  I will report back if the battery problem returns.Otherwise I prefer the Nook Simple Touch's ergonomics to the comparable Kindle.  The Nook's front is all screen, with no unnecessary keyboard keys.  Virtual keyboard keys appear onscreen when you need to search for something.  The unit fits nicely in the back pocket of my jeans or shorts, and it's trim and lightweight.There are convenient page turning buttons flanking the screen, making for easy one-handed operation in a subway.  You have a choice of font styles and sizes, and the screen is easy to read even under bright sunlight.  You can touch any word onscreen to get a quick dictionary definition (provided, I found, that the word isn't hyphenated and run on two lines).I like the ease with which you can download titles from the public library (you download to Adobe Digital Reader, which your library provides free, and then transfer the Epub books to your Nook with the USB cable provided).  The program recognized my Nook without any glitches.I also like being able to read any book for an hour a day FREE at the nearby B&N; store.Newbies should note that, in their apparent effort to keep the NST instructions short and simple, B&N; left out a few useful ones.  Notably: to close one book (so you can open another), press the Nook button below the screen (the thing that looks like an upside-down U) and enter ""library.""  To lock the Nook immediately, without waiting for it to enter sleep mode, press the power button on the back briefly.  And to tell when the Nook has finished charging, wait for the little LED next to the USB input on the unit to turn from amber to green.So if you have been looking for an ebook reader offering great value and ergonomics, take a look at this Nook.  But make sure to upgrade to firmware V1.0.1 or higher!)UPDATE: Trust me to find the bugs in an ebook reader -- or perhaps they find me.  At any rate, I bought a copy of the American Heart Association Cookbook (7th Edition) and was dismayed to see some of the fractions describing quantities in recipes replaced by question marks!I emailed B&N; Customer Support, and they suggested that I try downloading the title again (which you do by archiving and unarchiving a title, whatever that means).  That didn't work, but I found that if I clicked the check box on the font selection screen marked ""Publisher's Default"" (or words to that effect), that seemed to solve the problem.  So if you're seeing question marks in any titles where numbers should be, try that solution!I sure love beta testing new products for these big companies -- NOT!",2011-08-28,A1EARN5PUVIF1S,Jerry P.

506,140053271X,"[1, 2]",3.0,"I don't read a ton so I didn't want to pay a huge premium for an e-reader.  I have an iPad but when I do read, sometimes staring at that screen for more than an hour can give me a headache.  It came down to this, the basic Kindle, and the new Kindle Paperwhite.  When I really thought about it, the Paperwhite was more than I really wanted to spend on something I would only use an hour or 2 a week.  I ultimately decided to get this because it could read epub files natively and didn't have to be converted to MOBI files which the Kindle uses.It wasn't quite as straight forward as I was expecting.  I initially thought it'd be like the iPad where you just drag the book into the Books section of iTunes and you're ready to go.  I dragged the books onto the Nook when it appeared on my desktop and nothing happened.  I found out you had to download ADE and set it up that way.  From there you have to add the books to ADE then add them to your Nook, not a huge deal, but a few extra steps compared to the iPad.I also noticed that scrolling between pages had a bit of delay compared to the iPad and that when you were trying to use the scroll bar to advance more than a few pages at a time, it wasn't the most accurate.  It also appears that page sync only works with content you purchase from them and not files you have already on your computer(I think the Kindle is the same way as well though).The reading experience is great though.  Its not too bright and easy on the eyes.  The Nook itself is pretty light so its not a hassle to hold it for awhile.  Library is also easy to scroll through once its on your device.Overall I am happy with it.  I mentioned its shortcomings, but they don't outweigh how easy it is to read and the overall reading experience.  From a reading standpoint I'd give it 5 stars, just some other things that popped up that aren't big deals, but noticable.

I was very frustated trying to get the menu display to stay there8) it took me a few mins before I can get the menu to be stable, then change to a smaller size. The text now reads fine.

And the epub size is much larger than PDF size (i.e. I will have a lot less books on it).To me, this eBook is useless, so I am going to return it back today.And this is not due to (or lack of) my high tech proficiency (I develop firmware for ""firwmare operated"" gadgets by trade , really know how to use these ""Software/firmware"" operated gadgets quite well, have at least 5 GADGETS with very complicated functionalities at home, all of them require patient readings thru their thick manuals to operate / setup to my liking, no problem at all).I have written quite a lot of product reviews on Amazon, most of the gave good rating because these products are good.I feel really frustrated with this one, the first bad review I wrote.My older two eBook readers work right of the box. Just copy the documents to it and open to read them.I will NEVER buy these kinds of eBook readers anymore, not even the new Kindle as I heard they will show ads on the screen and the Kindle Fire will just immediately buy stuff from Amazon if I accidently click on some place, IT DOES NOT even show a confirmation screen (too greedy to make money) !!! I don't buy something to read these ads. Amazon and B & N are too greedy trying to push stuff on the users as they feel like, at the users expense.I will try to get a new Android tablet instead (for reading, and Internet browsing).

I finally gave up in frustration after having it replaced 3 times in the first year.I bought the Nook Simple Touch to replace it, and am very satisfied with my purchase.To be honest, the Kindle is brighter and easier to read in less-than-perfect light.  However the Nook excels in nearly every other way.1) Nook is sturdily reliable.  I have had no failures with it whatsoever, although I carry it everywhere and use it daily.  I do have it in a protective case, but I had my Kindle in a protective case and it kept breaking anyway.  POINT:  NOOK.2) Nook Simple touch is smaller and lighter than the equivalent Kindle e-reader.  Nevertheless, screen-size is ample.3) Nook is responsive and seems faster at turning pages than Kindle.4) Books download in a blink and are immediately available.  This too seems faster than with my Kindle.5) There are some things I could do with my Kindle that I can't do with my Nook Simple Touch, but I don't miss those things.  I needed a simple e-reader that just plain works and Nook Simple Touch satisfies that need in a very inexpensive way WITHOUT ADS.

516,140053271X,"[3, 6]",2.0,"The device physically, is relatively good for the money.  There are many reviews on YouTube and other places that address that point.  The problem with the B&N; system is the fact that you must enter a 'default credit card' to be able to use or purchase any books.  If you were to buy this Nook for your young son or daughter, they would be able to purchase anything at the flick of a finger, and it would charge to your credit card 'for your convenience'.  Similarly, if anyone found your child's Nook, they too could purchase anything using your credit card information.I tried get creative and purchased a gift card for my child but although this can create a credit on the child's account, B&N; still requires a credit card to be on-file in order to 'unlock' the book.  By contrast, with the Kindle system, you simply buy a book through Amazon using any credit card (which does not have to stay active) and send it to an authorized device.  The Nook system, by comparison, is slow, clunky, and a massive security risk.If you setup the Nook and do not provide this credit card during setup, no books can be sent to the Nook wirelessly, they must be sync'ed with a cable tethered to a computer.  Since my 12 year-old daughter purchased this herself with her own money, I have no choice but to either tell her to eat the unit or use my credit card without any parental control.  Furthermore, it would appear that B&N; is entering into a contract with my minor daughter in this regard.  By opting out of this model, you are left with an utterly useless device.Why none of the other reviewers elaborate on this is beyond me.  I suppose if the device is owned by an adult this model would work, however if you are contemplating this as a gift for your child, I'd avoid any device related to B&N; altogether.I give them 2 starts for the hardware only but otherwise the device, in this case, is useless.  While you can delete your credit card from B&N;, the process is well hidden and you would need to add a card, order, download, sync, unlock, and then delete the card in order to get each purchase on the device.

518,140053271X,"[12, 12]",5.0,"Having previously owned a Kindle, I was not expecting that e-book readers had much improved over the last year. Contrast on the display was a big problem for me, and I wasn't especially keen that the Kindle uses a proprietary book format that cannot be read on other e-readers. So, as long as I stuck buying books from Amazon for a Kindle, I was fine; the second I ever wanted to move to another device, I couldn't take my books. This didn't sit well with me.When Barnes and Noble dropped the price of the Nook Simple Touch to $99 I decided to take the plunge. (Note that as of this writing, Amazon still has not reflected the price drop.) The newer generation screen, while still not perfect, is far, far superior than earlier generations. Reading indoors no longer requires a spotlight on the e-reader to maintain legibility. Anyone who owns an iPad or other tablet knows how intuitive a touch interface can be, so I'm delighted to say that the navigation issues previously posed by the joystick on the older Kindle are resolved with the Nook's new touch interface.Amazon released their own Touch e-reader just recently. While it now brings the Kindle in line with the capabilities of the Nook, it still lags in one area: proprietary book format. The Nook and all other major e-readers use EPUB, a now-standard file format for e-books. Amazon for its own reasons chooses not to. What this means in practical terms is that you pretty much have to buy all of your books from Amazon - and forget about taking them with you if you ever decide another e-reader is the better platform for you.I refuse to be a party to that kind of lock-in, which is why I am very happy with my Nook Simple Touch.",2011-11-16,ATDEJ6381GRZJ,M.

523,140053271X,"[1, 1]",5.0,"I tried to leave this review at barnesandnoble.com, but they never posted it. Oh well.The Nook Simple Touch is a great e-reader. If you are looking for a tablet like device to surf the internet and check email, this is not the product for you. The e-ink screen is amazing. It looks like you are reading a physical book. I like that you can turn the page by pressing the buttons or touching the side of the screen. Either way will be useful depending on how you are holding the book. This is very simple, which I love. One night, I was lying down in bed and went to lay the Nook on it's side then immediately jerked it back up before the page orientation changed. Then I remembered that it won't do that; which makes this great for reading no matter what position you may be sitting or lying in.The Nook accepts epub books; which means that you can get books from a variety of stores, not just Barnes & Noble. I found that between the B&N; store and Google Books, you can get all of the classics for free. No reason to pay for one of those ever again. Download Adobe Digital Editions to put books on from other places; including borrowed books from the public library.The Nook doesn't handle pdf's well on its own, but there is a work around. Download Calibre, bring your pdf's into it and then convert them into epubs.

524,140053271X,"[39, 44]",5.0,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Amazon.com. In the past month alone, I have made at least 12 purchases.  I was browsing around just now and decided to see what Amazon.com customers thought of my newest electronic device.  I was thrilled to see the high rating, but disappointed to see the price; $40.00 more than the thing costs at B/N since its release last month.  Amazon, you need to do better here!Now to the product - This is my first e-reader and I am certain that I went with the best product for me.  As someone who buys a lot of books from Amazon, I would have preferred to have bought the Kindle,especially since Amazon has more of the types of books I read and for much cheaper than B/N, but I just do not appreciate those tiny buttons on the device.  I absolutely LOVE my Nook Simple Touch, and I use it for several hours every day.  B/N has Free Fridays - when you can download a featured book for free -, book share -with contacts on your device and social networks, and free reading of selected books when you are in B/N.  My understanding is that I can go to local libraries and even borrow my books using my Nook; This may or may not be any special news.The touch screen is a bit sensitive on the device, so if you prefer not to use it, they are also tactile ""buttons"" that will allow you to change pages.  The home screen shows the book you are currently reading and the page number you are on - a few other books in your library, and some suggested readings.  You can create shelves that you name on which to house your books by categories. They do not look like physical shelves, rather they are just a grouping of books.Without going into more technical stuff that you can read online, I will say that if you are new to e-reading and you enjoy touch screens -  AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS YOU TO READ - Do not hesitate to go into a B/N and try this out.  Some people buy this expecting it to browse the web (although it does have a hidden browser that the techies are working to hack) - Play their audio files, when there is not headphone jack (Techies have discovered that it DOES have built-in bluetooth, however), and folks buy this and complain that they do not like how it does not display their magazines in color.  It is not meant to do that - it is meant to be solely an enjoyable easy-to-use reading device that does not give you a whole lot of options to be distracted from the task at hand, READING!This is why I bought it - Eventually, I will get a nook color - or a Kindle *color* if they come out with one, but for now, I thoroughly  enjoy my Nook, which has encouraged me to slow down and spend so much more time in the peaceful, leisurely act of reading. In my excitement, I am reading like 8 different books at once.  That is the great joy of having an e-reader - speaking to those who are, just as I used to be, resistant to the e-reading craze - there is no more lugging around a bag filled with books, and when I get tired of reading one, another book is just a couple of swipes away. I am learning about how to get all sorts of books for free or low cost, as well as learning how to take advantage of conversion and e-book management tools such as Calibre.  I am having a blast with this thing!Yesterday, I received a nice leather case for it that I purchased off Ebay for a great price.

526,140053271X,"[3, 3]",2.0,"This is an update from my initial review.This Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch was advertised by BlueProton at Amazon as having been marked down from $249.99 to $68.99, so it certainly seemed like a great deal. It now seems like fraudulent advertising because I've since read that the MSRP is $79.99Initially I had serious problems with the Nook, and requested a refund. The seller, BlueProton, refused to take returns or give a refund for it, and directed me to Barnes & Noble who referred me back to the seller, stating  that the seller should refund it within 14 days; at that time  I'd only had it a few days. My Amazon A to Z claim ended with Amazon siding with the seller, BlueProton because their policy stated that they would not accept returns on Nooks - something I did not see when I initially read their policy!Because neither BlueProton nor Barnes & Noble would take responsibility for the defective product, and their attitude was ""Take the money and run!"", I'm giving the Nook a low review although later I found an update for the Nook which resolved the problems - with no help or information from either seller or Barnes & Noble!I now enjoy using the Nook which is so much easier and more comfortable to hold than regular books while reading,  and to carry back & forth to work each day or to travel with. I don't like the gray screen which requires you to face the Nook towards the light; and I don't like the glare on the screen from the sun or lights. I have to sit ""just so"" to read it - which somewhat defeats the idea of portability. Overall I do like it, but it needs improvement.My favorite use of the Nook is to borrow my local library's digital books using the free Overdrive Media Console software which allows you to select & save your library (ies) and to directly access the digital library from it on your PC, and then sideload (drag & drop)the borrowed books to your Nook; no more time wasted or trips through rush hour traffic to browse, borrow or return books downtown, and no more parking hassles! Most of my library's digital books are in ePub format which is the native format of the Nook. However, as other reviewers have stated, you can still borrow or buy Kindle or other formats of digital books and convert them to ePub via the free Calibre software. Borrowed library books can be returned automatically when the loan periods expire, or can be returned manually earlier if you decide not to finish the book during the loan period.Ordinarily I don't buy many fiction books because I rarely read any of them more than once. Additionally, due to the poor customer service from both Amazon (who owns Kindle) and Barnes & Noble (who owns Nook) I am determined to rarely buy any books from either of these companies, and will primarily download either their free books or the library's loan books. The companies want us to buy their ebooks, but won't take responsibility for their e-readers, so that infuriates me and alienates me for life.The pros: the low price; comfort; convenience; savings from being able to borrow library books instead of buying something you'll only read once; no clutter of physical books; easy loaning to friends with a guarantee that they will be returned in 14 days (automatic returns); ability to read multiple formats via conversion in free Calibre software. The Nook can also read your PDF files/documents from your PC or elsewhere, plus it can use your JPEG files of photos to use as your custom screensavers; the Nook will convert them to B&W.;The cons: PlueProton's and Barnes & Nobles's total lack of responsibility for their defective Nooks - why I gave the Nook such a low rating; Amazon's siding with Blue Proton's irresponsible returns policy; dreary gray screen which makes it difficult to read except in bright lighting; touch screen not as sensitive and responsive as it should be - often have to touch the screen a few times before getting a response.Over all I'm pleased with my Nook Simple Touch now that I managed to FIX IT BY MYSELF, but the companies' irresponsible policies have soured me towards them for life.",2013-02-26,A3L9NGPTBJBQEL,Po Po,no responsibility from sellers for initially defective  new product,1361836800.0,1.0,2013,2,4098.0,67,update initial review barnes noble nook simple touch advertised blueproton amazon marked certainly seemed like great deal seems like fraudulent advertising since read msrp initially serious problem nook requested refund seller blueproton refused take return give refund directed barnes noble referred back seller stating seller refund within day time day amazon z claim ended amazon siding seller blueproton policy stated would accept return nook something see initially read policy neither blueproton barnes noble would take responsibility defective product attitude take money run giving nook low review although later found update nook resolved problem help information either seller barnes noble enjoy using nook much easier comfortable hold regular book reading carry back forth work day travel like gray screen requires face nook towards light like glare screen sun light sit read somewhat defeat idea portability overall like need improvement favorite use nook borrow local library digital book using free overdrive medium console software allows select save library y directly access digital library pc sideload drag drop borrowed book nook time wasted trip rush hour traffic browse borrow return book downtown parking hassle library digital book epub format native format nook however reviewer stated still borrow buy kindle format digital book convert epub via free calibre software borrowed library book returned automatically loan period expire returned manually earlier decide finish book loan period ordinarily buy many fiction book rarely read additionally due poor customer service amazon owns kindle barnes noble owns nook determined rarely buy book either company primarily download either free book library loan book company want u buy ebooks take responsibility e reader infuriates alienates life pro low price comfort convenience saving able borrow library book instead buying something read clutter physical book easy loaning friend guarantee returned day automatic return ability read multiple format via conversion free calibre software nook also read pdf file document pc elsewhere plus use jpeg file photo use custom screensavers nook convert b w con plueproton barnes noble total lack responsibility defective nook gave nook low rating amazon siding blue proton irresponsible return policy dreary gray screen make difficult read except bright lighting touch screen sensitive responsive often touch screen time getting response pleased nook simple touch managed fix company irresponsible policy soured towards life,responsibility seller initially defective new product

It has a soft plastic outside with a curved back that makes holding the device quite pleasant. It has just enough area around the screen that you can hold easily without mistakenly turning pages. And the side page turn buttons are deep enough you won't turn pages by accident.

536,140053271X,"[3, 5]",2.0,"I bought the Nook Touch instead of the Kindle because it was on sale for $75, which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books. I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N;, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N.; If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!

542,1400532736,"[5, 7]",1.0,"No stars. Be warned, potential B&N customer: if you have a problem with a defective brand-new, just-delivered Nook device, you're likely headed for Customer Service hell. Be prepared to meet with an army of know-nothing, apparently deceptive incompetents. Any merits of B&N's Nook products are offset by the company's Customer Service from hell. Today, trying to resolve the problem of having just received a Nook Simple Touch lemon, I've been lied to, hung up on, and received no help at all. The return call, promised by a supervisor at around six this evening, never came. So, around 4 hours later, I called back and spoke to another supervisor, identifying myself and asking for help. This call was disconnected on B&N's side, and that supervisor never called me back or emailed me to provide service.  I've also been advised that I'll have to wait quite a while for a replacement Nook, though I live in Manhattan and the site promises same-day Manhattan delivery. I'd read reviews on the B&N site and, I believe, on Amazon as well, about B&N's horrific so-called Customer Service. I can see now, from experience, that the horror stories are true. So if you buy a Nook from B&N and get a lemon, as can happen with any e-device, you're going to find yourself quite alone with your problem. Whatever the merits of the Kindle, I know from experience that Amazon Customer Service lives up to its name. B&N Customer Service is essentially an insult to customers. I don't work for either company. I'm just a customer with a brand-new defective Nook Simple Touch, and I can't get any help from B&N.

Our local library offers ebooks so I thought it would be great.After getting the Nook, I learned a number of things:1. The Nook does NOT have a browser. It can only connect to the Barnes and Noble online bookstore.2. You are REQUIRED to have a valid credit card, even to download free content.3. While there is a way to root (hack) the Nook and thus enable a functional browser, it voids the warranty and is way too complicated to follow. I shouldn't have to hack a device to enable such a basic functionality.My mother isn't very computer savvy, and doesn't own a credit card, so I couldn't give her something like this. If it let you connect to library sites and download library books for free, it would be an ideal ereader. In it's current form, it's an overly-complicated money sinkhole. Now I'm out $70 and I still need to buy my mother a birthday present.I don't know why some of these other reviewers claim it can be used to download library ebooks.

552,1400532736,"[8, 10]",5.0,"I'll be writing this review in stages, as I hit stopping points.Lightweight, nice screen, cute, low-profile buttons around the rim.  Touch screen is about as responsive as my iphone 4s.  Includes cable that has a standard USB a jack that plugs into just about everything: the computer, my hub, and the standard variety of wall worts and car chargers.This device is hard directed for ""easy setup"".  Too hard.  There should be a way to accept the TOU and get to using the device.  Forcing wifi setup and registration is just bad planning.Wifi - This is the stupidest thing about this device.  Once you charge it up, you turn it on, it asks for you to agree to terms, then it goes through wifi setup.  Note, you must HAVE wifi, AND connect to it successfully for the setup process to continue.  At this time, I'm stuck.  I'm in a town with limited wifi options, so it's not like I can just select a local hotspot.  Until i register the device, I have a brick.I have an old Netgear Router 802.11g&b; with wep and wpa protection.  The nook is capable of wpa2 security, but managed the wep and wpa security pretty nicely.  Strange thing was that I could get past the password, but it still would not connect to the internet (I checked the setup with my iPhone and everything worked fine).  Customer service had very few answers and only about 3 steps for me to take to fix the problem.  I tiered up to the supervisor and managed to pry out of her that the Nook runs on an 802.1x EAP network.  Upon googling it, this looks like the same network that causes a lot of android problems.  Next step is to hunt down a public wifi and try again.However: As soon as the thing charged and turned on, it showed up on my desktop and I was able to upload screensavers, books, documents, etc.  The device has a VERY small available memory, (about 250Mb), so text only books can be loaded, but not large PDFs (I bought this to enjoy the Modernist Cuisine series, 300Mb+ PDFs).  I had an old version of Calibre that worked right away.I'll change this review and maybe the two stars rating once I have something more than an expensive SD card reader to play with.UPDATE (after a stop at Denny's)Okay, sure enough, Once in a local restaurant with free wifi, I was able to connect, register and start using my nook.  I made sure I had a couple books on it when I left, so I was able to read a chapter before I paid the check.In good light, this screen is beautiful.  The characters are crisp and clear, it's easy to read, and you can make several screen adjustments including a limited list of fonts, size and margins.  In lower light, the dark grey on light grey screen gets tougher to read than, say, a printed sheet of paper.  Still, in my apt with only a 60 watt light illuminating the room, it's still pretty easy to read.You get two choices on how the side buttons function.  Personally, I like the lower one turning the page forward; because I tend to hold it in the lower corner, cupped in my hand.  However, you can swipe the screen to turn pages, too.The OS on the nook is a little simpler than, say the kindle fire.  And maybe that's why I like it better.  On this device, books are books are books.  They can be epubs, pdfs, purchased or uploaded, they all go the same place, and they all end up in the same list.  Nothing grinds my gears more than having to look 2-3 places for things based on where you bought them, or some other phantom difference established by the designers (or worse, the marketing department - I'm looking at you Kindle).  The down side to this that if you have a large ebook library, you are pretty much stuck using the search function.  There doesn't seem to be a way to organize books any other way. [checking online....] Oh crap, they have this whole ""shelf"" system built in.  Damn, scratch that organizational thing, I'll get back to ya there.Screen Savers.Forget about those fancy things on your PC, the nook's idea of a screen saver is to place a picture on the screen when it sleeps.  The default is a bunch of pictures of famous authors.  nice, you can also choose nature scenes.  But, remember I said that you could upload directly to the nook?  Well, here ya go. Create a folder with the name of your screen saver set, upload some 800x600 pics (jpg/png formats) in portrait mode and Voila! You have your own custom set.  I went to nook.com and downloaded a bunch of Str Trek Geeky stuff at first, but then realized I could just take a few snapshots and convert them to 16 greys myself.  Now I have a folder of a dozen of MY pictures as the screen saver.  Very nice.  Kinda like having an image viewer as well.Calibre.Getting calibre to work with the device once it was working was a complete breeze.  I bought a 16gb micro SD on sale and added it.  The card mounts on the desktop separately, but calibre is all tuned up to read them correctly.  So, when you put stuff on the device, you have the option of loading it in main memory or on the card.  Come to think of it, a series of small cards could be another way to organize as well.  Put your SF collection on this card, classics on that one, etc.  Fun.Oh, also, once I got the registration completed at Denny's I went into settings and disconnected the wifi.  It's been operating in that mode ever since.  So, only that first time is needed.Adding two more stars for all the juicy goodness.  I'll play around with it a while and see if we can get it to 5.  No real serious problems yet.UpdatePDFs - Okay, so pretty much everything else that displays pdfs tries to incorporate the formatting of the document.  This strange little device actually reads the text (easiest way to save formatting = text + format), and produces it in standard format.  It's a little disorienting but it makes for a much more consistent reading experience.Micro SDI think my real problem with this device was getting a huge SD card for this then thinking I had to fill it with a whole library.  Bah!  Granted, those 6 really large PDFs need some room, but I could have fit them all on a 2 Gb card and still had plenty of room to spare.  *sigh*  All that room meant I could have 100s of books on the device.  Think: Tim Taylor "" More Power!"" {grunt grunt}Shelves.  The device keeps track of the shelves internally, so it's not like a document you could edit outside the device and use your computer's search function to organize.  you MUST go through your entire library, no search functions, one book at a time to add to shelves.  Great if you know what you're looking for, but not all sets start with Lord of the Rings 1: ....If you buy this, don't get an external card right away.  the onboard memory can hold a lot of stuff.  Shorter onboard lists mean you have less stress with shelves and such.I won't be exploring the B&N; store for a while (a Long while).  I have a massive library to work through first.  So look elsewhere for those reviews.  I've heard the store is mighty nice though.No ads, easy to use, a joy to read.  This, my final entry sees that last star moving up the device.  Take heed of the speedbumps I've experienced and enjoy this cute little reader.  Now, I just need a case.....  :)ANOTHER UPDATE: Months later and I've read a small library on this thing.  It's a delight.  but I still find myself avoiding PDFs a lot because of the disorientation.  Also: to the 2 people who did NOT find this review helpful - Bite me.

554,1400599997,"[212, 215]",5.0,"MORE UPDATES at the bottom of my review!My review includes details of Kindle 3, the newest version! With the time period, I could still return my nook, but I'm still completely in love with it and don't want the kindle for the reasons below.I was one of those people who was averse to the idea of an e-reader for a long time. I liked the feel of a real book, I was in love with free books at the library, why would I start paying for them? Then, my library got ""overdrive"", which is e-books FREE from the library. Then one day soon after, I woke up and the urge for an e-reader was there. The Nook was my final choice. It took a lot of back and forth and research to get to this point. I bought and tried the Sony Touch reader, returned it, and went and got the Nook. I really honestly wanted the Kindle most, because I'm a loyalist. I love Amazon and felt really comfortable here if I decided to actually start purchasing books again. But below, I'll give you comparisons to the three big readers and the reasons I got the nook:- Nook(N) by barnes & noble- Kindle 3(K) by amazon.com- Sony Reader Touch(ST)1. My biggest decision maker was Epub. This is the format in which you can take ebooks out of the library, so I needed whatever I got to be Epub friendly.N: The Nook is epub friendly. As well as PDF, and many other formats.K: The Kindle won't use Epub, which was all I needed to know. It mainly uses it's own Amazon format,while it also uses PDF, mobi and a few others. It makes me feel like Amazon is being greedy, wanting us to only use and buy books from the amazon site. Don't they understand that I love my library?ST: Sony reader is Epub friendly. pretty much the same as the nook.2. PRICE!N: 149 with wifiST: 169 NO WIFIK: 139 with wifi(or 189 with wifi and free 3G)While kindle 3 is 10 dollars cheaper, it doesn't give me those free library books, so it really doesn't make any difference to me.*You can now lend some books from the Nook for 14 days to a friend with their new ""lend me"" technology. While this is in beta stages, and not ALL books are lendable. It depends on the agreement with the publisher. The other two you cannot lend at all.*The Nook has a replaceable, rechargable battery. So it'll last awhile, but when its dwindling, you can spend 30 bucks and put a new one in yourself. For the Kindles, they are sealed inside. People have said you can do it yourself, but you must be tech savvy. Or you can send it away to Amazon for about the cost of [...]+shipping charges and they'll replace it for you.*You can expand your memory on the Nook and on the Sony touch. The Kindle you cannot, though the Kindle will hold 3,500 books, don't know if you need more space then that?!*Nook has a fancy color touch screen at the bottom. While the Sony touch has a touch screen(the entire screen), it was slow to respond, very klunky and not very pretty. The kindle is loaded with buttons along the outside of the screen.* all three have a built in dictionary, which I think is just awesome.*The new kindle now meets with the nook on their slim width. People used to say the nook was more comfortable to hold because of the width, now the kindle will be as well.*Yet, the Nook is heavier by about 3 oz then the Kindle or Sony.*The Nook battery life lasts about 10 days with wifi off, the Sony has 14 days, and the new kindle is up to a month with wifi off(3 weeks with it on)This wasn't a big deal to me, and I was more interested in the other features the Nook DID have, like replaceable battery and expandable memory.*And you may be wondering, why did I purchase a Sony Touch, and then scamper back hours later to return it? Well. When I got it out of the box, it wasn't techy enough for me. It felt like a very basic, bare bones E-reader. And I already had in my head all the things you hear about the nook: books more expensive, and for some reason I thought it wasn't epub friendly. But the moment I had that Sony in my hand, I went to look at the nook more indepth online. The Sony online library was nothing in comparison to Kindle's Amazon.com or Nook's Barnes & Noble. One of my favorite reads recently was The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. It was nowhere to be found on Sony. That gave me a bad taste in my mouth.*In the past people have complained that Barnes & Noble is significantly more expensive then Amazon. I did some price comparisons of big titles, and found them most of the time to be exactly the same. I think Barnes & Noble might be trying to keep in line with Amazon to draw more readers(Like ME!) into getting the Nook.On the whole, the nook is everything I wanted. I've downloaded some free classics from google books, I've taken out library ebooks and it was REALLY easy! I even bought my first book(well, ebook) in a long time. Despite being a new release, it was under ten bucks. I also bought another book I've been meaning to read for years for under four dollars. The nook is comfortable to hold with one hand. I like the using the touch screen to ""swipe"" and turn pages. And tops on my list, I didn't feel horrificly guilty for buying it. One fifty is a reasonable price for such a fun new book reader.Update Oct '10: A software update is coming in Nov:""dramatically increase page turn speed, customized B&N; Library organization and password protection. It also includes the ability to sync across all NOOK and all devices enabled with our free NOOK apps, by syncing your last page read. If you forget your NOOK at home, use the NOOK app for iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, Android smartphone or PC to pick up where you left off. And, the next time you pick up your NOOK, the Reading Now page will be updated and ready to go.Update Dec '10: The update was a pinch to install, and it has some stellar perks that make the nook even more loveable. The shelving option it a lot of fun for those people who like to organize. You can name a shelf anything you want. The only limit is your Barnes and Noble book will stay in their Barnes folder, while any other books you have will stay in My Documents. The page turn is very fast. I do read across multiple devices, but for most people that will be a great new feature.",2010-07-20,A1DQHS7MOVYYYA,A.

Kindle requires new hardware. I just read a new one will be out in August '10, and no, no touch screen!2) Amazon (Kindle) is not a dedicated book store whose sole livelihood is books, like B&N; (nook).  Amazon has demonstrated this with its wrangling with publishers to the dismay of both the publishers and Amazon's customers3) Yes, the nook was rushed out last year but they are now already on V1.3 software, but it works well and has added features and corrected some early flaws.  The page turns are now quicker and very acceptable, especially compared with a real book page turn.  Whoever you are with, they will have some problems and features you do or don't like.  There are supposedly more books via B&N;, but never the books you actually want to read - Kindle has some missing for me as well as B&N.;B&N; will no doubt keep updating its software regularly and Amazon make you pay for new Kindles (and risk you not being able to read your e-books on the next version, like V1 to V2)E-book pricing is a little crazy right now as publishers seem to be trying to establish the ""value"" of e-books versus paperback/hardcover.  Some e-books are more expensive and some are changing prices weekly.  It's the same situation with both Kindle and nook from what I can tell.4) The touch screen is a nice feature (future-proofed hardware), but big fingers can hit the wrong selection occasionally.  It is comparable with the iTouch touchscreen performance IMHO.  Navigation is maybe more hassle than the Kindle as a result.  This also makes the nook smaller (no physical keyboard to worry about) and easier to hold, even though it is marginally heavier than the Kindle.5) The nook can be personalized with your own photos for wallpaper and screen-savers (wrong wording as it's just a picture for when the nook is in sleep mode - No burn-in with e-ink screens). You can add more storage in a nook with a micro SD card6) The Kindle battery lasts longer, but the nook is fine with the Wi-Fi turned off - about 10 hours.  The nook battery is user-replaceable and costs just $29, unlike the Kindle7) The nook extended warranty covers ANY accidental breakage/spillage for the full 2 years.8) A B&N; store is always nearby to get help in person and they currently offer a free book per week when you visit the store (in week 2 of 5 right now)9) Using independent free software available on the web (Calibre), I can convert and ""sideload"" documents and news feeds to my nook.  I have sideloaded web pages (originally saved as HTML), word documents and .pdf's, all in .epub format.  This is no doubt possible with Kindle too, but the nook is more than flexible for my needs.  I read USA Today and The BBC news feeds on my nook every day and they include B&W; photos and diagrams which are clearly readable.  Calibre has many more available.10) Using Sigil, again free software, I can modify e-books to add chapters or correct errors and sideload them to my nook.  Again, no doubt a possibility with Kindle, but I am not sure.11)  Nook is just the one size, no Kindle DX equivalent.  For my needs though, the small nook is ""back pocket"" sized (literally fitting in my back pocket) and is small enough to read but carry around.  I need reading glasses without exception to read and so can read at the smallest text size with no problem.12)  I'm not bothered about having a music player and the built-in speakers are not really capable as listening devices (tinny and low volume), but it's there and will no doubt allow for text-to-speech in a future software release, which will be useful.  The sound quality through headphones is good.I've had my nook a week and have read two books and many daily news articles.  It's comfortable to use, it's fun to use and while maybe a luxury we could all do without, I've read a couple free e-books that otherwise, I would never have done - and I have many more downloaded and ready in the wings.  It's actually now a hassle to read through a real paperback or hardcover.  :-)The choice is yours, but my choice was the nook and I think it was a good choice.UPDATE 6/2/10 - .PDF's on the nookI have found that .pdf books, especially with charts and diagrams (ie technical/text books) are problematic to read on the nook.  Interestingly the B&N; store personnel stated that they had never tried to read a .pdf on the nook - maybe just a way to avoid the issue??  However, the Kindle will no doubt have the same issue, unless you use the DX which is larger and so you can read .pdf's natively.If you read a native .pdf on the nook it is the whole page squeezed down to the 5"" screen - impossible to read.  If you use Calibre to convert the .pdf to .epub format, then the end result is variable.  Diagrams get screwed up or disappear and while text can be enlarged with the font size function, even the text formatting may or may not be acceptable.Either way, I have given up trying to read such books on my nook.  :-(I would not recommend the nook to anyone trying to use it for school where .pdf's are the only format available.  The problem is not nook/Kindle, but the way .pdf's are created.  They don't have the necessary information encoded to be able to convert them to other e-reader formats and retain their .pdf look.  If you are going to save any documents for conversion to .epub format, don't use .pdf.  I have found saving as .HTML renders a perfectly acceptable .epub file when converted, including diagrams and charts when archiving web pages, for example.See also my review of the JAVOedge Snake Skin Case for Barnes & Nobles Nook (Flip Style)",2010-05-30,A4WCZVA328QB4,Allen D.

560,1400599997,"[0, 7]",5.0,"I bought a Nook during one of my visits to Tampa, more specifically at the Wiregrass Shops. I must admit that I was tremendously excited when I got the device, because of the reviews and also the SD card capability.My joy was short lived. During the 2 weeks that I owned the product I was never able once to open none of my sideloaded pdf's that I have amassed over the years (over 30GB - I am a voracious reader). A long string of calls to Customer Service and the shop itself ensued, after which I decided to take the trip again (I live outside of the USA) to return the device directly to the store.Much to my surprise, they were extremely receptive at the store and also very apologetic for the device's inability to function properly outside the States and also the lack of functionality and propietary issues.

561,1400599997,"[25, 25]",5.0,"So, I bought the nook a few weeks ago when the price cut went into action and was constantly going back and forth with the thoughts of buying this, or buying the kindle.I bought the device with 3G simply because it was only a little more, and I travel a lot and don't have house wi-fi. I remember when I used to scoff at the nook when walking into B&N; and can't believe I ever did that! I love the feel of being able to go into the bookstore, with my nook and feel connected to the actual store. I will admit you have to do your research (read forums, articles etc...) because the nook demo employees, are not going to know everything. Also you MUST read the 'manual' and follow it to a 'T' Don't take the reader out of the box and drain what little battery you have left because you're going to have battery issues (needing it to drain completely a few times and then fully charging it before the battery is at full capacity)A lot of people may think their nook is 'frozen' when actually the battery is drained, and when that happens the screen is set to whatever screen saver, book page etc you were on when it died. There's no 'power-down' it will just stop, and touchscreen will not be active, once you plug it up and charge it a little, it will be good again. Also the constant use of the touchscreen will drain the unit faster (obvious unfortunate fact)There are a lot of books available at the moment (depending what genre you read) especially for teen and sci-fi and fiction (my books), and I was surprised to see all of the 'lend me features' for a good portion of the books I was interested in. Also B&N; really listens to complaints and proves that with upgrades (faster page turning, less freezing etc.)Also even when there was a manufacturing error, they were quick to send out a new improved nook. Overall, I love this device, it's fun, its sleek with a solid feel, and it's open-ended for future updates.It may be for you, it may not.

562,1400599997,"[3, 5]",3.0,"After what I thought was a thorough research between the Kindle, nook & Sony ereaders, I took the plunge & bought the nook. What appealled to me most were the web browser & ePub use to check out books from the library. However, after fully charging the nook, I took it with me for a weekend at the beach. I didn't bring the the charger because B&N; said battery would last up to 10 days with wireless off. Well, I found out the hard way, with wireless on, it barely a couple hours reading at night & in the afternoon by the beach. Oy, was I frustrated with nothing left to read & another night & afternoon left. Lesson learned: must bring charger everywhere! Lost 1 * for this.I'm not a fan of touch screens, still love my trusty push-button cellphone. So browsing the web was a pain for me, having to navigate around the screen with my finger. Page turning was fine, but I think I've overdone it since my finger began stinging from constant page-turning friction :0)). Scrolling down & up also frustrates me - most of the time I have to swipe several times to get it to move. Not to mention hitting the back button after book downloads - the response time was slow which made me think it didn't sense my touch, so I'd do it again & it goes back all the way to the main menu. Grrr! What a pain as I have to restart the store search & find the page again.B&N; samples are horrible! They give you 7 pages...but it's the cover, copyright, dedication page with only a paragraph of the actual story. Not enough to make me want to buy a book. The closest B&N; is 1 hour drive away so I couldn't take advantage of the cafe freebies or free reading in-store.After I discovered that I cannot organize books into folders, that was the final straw. I read novels with racy titles, my 10 y.o. son wanted to read his classics on the nook but I didn't want to lend it to him because he would see all my books & potentially read them. This is a biggie for me so lost another *.Features I'm happy with: I was able to check-out books from my library & I was able to put my pdf books on the nook. Yey! Unfortunately, my library just got into ebooks & have only a handfull of books so it'll be a while until I can fully take advantage of this feature.Well, these are my personal experiences with which I now realize that I didn't do a thorough reasearch as I first thought, LOL. My fault...but I still like my nook, though I'm no longer in love with it like when I first received it.

563,1400599997,"[2, 23]",1.0,".Paid $[...] for this in April 2010.  Biggest waste of money I ever spent.  not worth the hassle of getting it repaired.  Made me miserable and unhappy for three days.  This is not how I want to spend my life--feeling miserable and abused and wondering how I got suckered into this huge mistake.The good--or perhaps the OK--I found nothing really good.GSM service is free for purchasing books and most uses. Not all that valuable.  I'd be happy with just WiFi and enough memory to carry around a personal library. with me.  GSM available for anything else but books.  Wifi works ok, after some fussing with the settings.  Many times I got error messages.  I kept trying until it worked.  There is some issue with the Wifi but it can be fussed with until it works--starting and stopping it.The bad--just about everything:I travel a lot, and need to carry my library with me.  This device does not work to download books outside of the US.  Why not?  I can understand the GSM not working, but if I have WiFi access somewhere, I should be able to load anything I want anywhere.  I can load books anywhere with my iPod Touch. Requires a US address.  Why?  Why can't anyone use it?  Device requires that you sign up with B&N; with a credit card.  Why can't I download free books without a B&N; account?  You cannot use this device until it is registered.This device is barely functional.  The interface is poorly designed, B&N; does a great job of making it difficult to find free books, and the books that are normally free--B&N; charges you $1 to $2 for these books! Outrageous!  Most people would not have a clue they are being ripped off being charged for books in the public domain.The interface is so bad that everyone is hacking these devices to make them functional.  Do a GOOGLE search for nook soft root--better yet check out YouTube and search for TROOK.Do a search on nook itself for free and you won't find free books, you will find books with ""free"" in the title or crippled editions with two chapters free.  There is no menu selection for find free books.  If you do find a free book it will be after wading through page after page of the same title--it would take days to find even a few interesting free books.  With the Kindle, at least you get to choose a few best sellers are part of your purchase price.  The B&N; give you nothing for free but garbage.  They want to frustrated enough to pay them more money for overpriced books.  Personally I can't see paying the same price for an electronic book as I do a paper bound book that I can resell or give as a gift.  Electronic books cost nothing to produce and distribute--why do they cost so much?  It is gouging, IMHO.To get a free book into your nook is a nightmare PITA.  I use an iPod Touch and was able to load 60 free books into it, in about 8 minutes--easy and simple.  Not menu after menu and then find out the book was not loaded after all.With B&N; nook it takes a long time to select and load a book.  You have to pay for a book, even if it is zero dollars--another menu choice, just to get you in the habit of hitting a purchase button.  There are lots of free books out there.  Why should it be hard to load these? Personally, I want a large library with me because I travel alot, and I want to find  what I want quickly, and I want to read it without hassle.PFD files can be loaded but these are not re-sized, so that type is pretty small and hard to read.  I can't read them, and I have reasonably good near vision.  If you are young with perfect vision you might be able to read for a while until your eyes get tired.  PDF don't work well on this device.Changing a page is a pain with the controls.  There is a way to use a finger swipe that some people have difficulty with.I personally hate wading through 40-60 pages on the life of the author, at the beginning of the book when all I want to do is read the book itself.  Books with a ton of crap in the front, with articles about the life of the author, acknowledgments, are a PITA toget around.  Scrolling down to chapter one to start the book is problematic--sometimes you are sent back to the index, other times you go to Chapter one. Why should I have to scroll and enter a command twice.  Why can't it work the first time?I constantly had the urge to use the white part of the device as a touch screen, but only the bottom is a touch screen.  I found myself thinking, my iPod Touch is better than this.  It is fast to touch what I want.  Give me something better like a Blackberry pointer ball!Display is flashing every time a page is changed.  I found this constantly annoying.  Why?  There is no reason for the flashing.  EVERY PAGE FLASHES AT YOU!  YOU WILL LEARN TO HATE IT!!!!USB power connector.  This is a weak spot of the device.  Instead of using a robust connector, they use a micro USB connector. It is wobbly. Even a mini-USB would have been better.  At times I  could not make this connector work.  It is delicate.  It doesn't want to mate up.  I found I needed to be very precise on aligning it, even then it would not connect.  I doubt that this will survive 100 re-connections.  If you buy this device, do not expect it to last more than two years.  It would be smart to get the extended warrantee--another $60 for two years--If you buy a nook.  Charge it only when you have too, or you will wear out this connector in a short period of time.  While the battery life is good, given the crappy connector, I don't understand why they didn't put a battery 2-3 times larger in this device so that the connector would last longer and have less wear.Memory Storage is limited to about 1GB with space to add another memory card.  To bring it up to 8 or 16 GB, it will cost you another $30 to $60, or if you buy it from B&N; it will be twice as much.  I feel the device is worthless without at least another 8GB of storage.  I'd rather it came with another 16GB.  The iPad comes with that much or more--so you get a color full touch screen for not much more than the cost of the memory you need.This is a good gift for someone clueless about electronics that won't know any better about how badly B&N; crippled their android operating system and don't understand what a good interface is all about.Do yourself a favor.  Try an iPod Touch, and I assume the iPad works as well.  Apple makes quality products that work right, with strong connectors, great software, and are backed up with the highest rated customer support.  B&N; built something with one purpose only, to sell electronic books--and to make it difficult to find free books, and to break quickly.  If you want to be screwwed over, buy one of these and then bend over because B&N; sees you as someone to be used and abused--not a valuable customer.If B&N; made it easy to download free books, I'd be more forgiving on the crappy software they use and the delicate power connector.  If B&N; made a decent, usable interface, and made it easy to load whole library's of free books, I'd probably buy some electronic books and they would earn my business.  As it is, I will never buy an e-Book or any other book from B&N.;  That is how angry I am about wasting money on this product.My nook is dead after only three days.  I wish I could return it.  I don't have the original packaging either, so that even if I got a new replacement, I cannot sell it on eBay to get my money back.  I'm not sure what I'll do.  I will be calling B&N; tomorrow to see about a replacement, and begging for a store credit instead so I can buy an iPad instead.The bottom line is, I'm more than disappointed about the product.  I'm angry enough that I'll never do business with B&N; again--even if they refund me the price of this device.  I don't even want it back if it were repaired.I'd rather pay $600 for an iPad, purchasing from a company that charges a lot for products that are well thought out and work well.

564,1400599997,"[2, 2]",5.0,"After reading many technical and customer reviews of both the Nook and the Kindle, I purchased the Nook.  I think that both the Nook and Kindle are good products, but the Nook offers the user some unique advantages over its counterpart--the Kindle. First, a buyer can actually test drive the Nook before purchasing it at either Best Buy or at a Barnes and Noble store. The Kindle is only available on line at Amazon.com.  I cannot invest my hard earned money into buying an electronic device without trying it out first. The physical design of the Nook is attractive, sturdy, and compact. Navigating is easy. The user does not have to use the left/right arrows on the Nook to turn the page of an ebook.  The pages of a book can be easily turned by simply swiping the touch screen. Bookmarks can also be set. This is an important feature for me since I tend to read more than one book at a time. Secondly, the Nook offers web browsing.  I was able to link my Nook to my home wireless network and surf web pages.  Although the software is still in its beta stages, I am impressed at what I can already do.  Next, I can download and/or design wallpapers and screensavers for the Nook. This might be a minor point, but it makes the Nook unique and customizable for its owner. The Nook's storage capacity can be expanded. The Nook comes with 2GB of storage that the user can expand up to 16GB by purchasing and installing a micro SD card. The Nook's internal battery lasts about five years with normal use (this is according to technical reviewers), and a replacement battery can be purchased and installed by the user. Nook users also have a community forum they can join on the Barnes and Noble website to share ideas, tips, and news about the Nook. Also, improvements in the Nook software updates are due to customer input. I like for my suggestions to be heard and the Nook engineering team is listening. Don't take my word for it.

565,1400599997,"[51, 67]",1.0,"I'll admit up front that when I chose the Nook over Kindle and Sony's e-reader, I was impressed by that nifty full color touchscreen at the bottom of reading screen.  Glitz does not equal function, as I promptly found out.To be fair to Nook, if ALL you want to do is read, the device works, and works pleasantly.  I received my Nook in February, so it had the latest firmware updates, and I experienced none of the delays in downloading, missed sections of books, delays in page turning that early reports noted.  But if I was attempting to do anything more than clicking the page turning buttons, OUCH!The nifty little full color touchscreen (NOT to be confused with the e-paper reading screen, which is permanently gray-scale) just can't do it's job.  It responds slowly and inconsistently to touch, is quirky in its response, and virtually (no pun intended) unusable.  The virtual keyboard:  what a nightmare.  It's a true challenge to type more than one or two words without making an error, and trying to fix that error degenerates into a tragi-comedy in short order.The unit itself is pleasant to the hand, and comfortable.  It's also darn slick in its appearance, and if aesthetics  are your only criteria, well, go for it.  But here is why I returned the Nook after one week:  any optional feature, such as bookmarking, highlighting text and annotating it, search functions for previous book marks and annotations:  purely a nightmare.  The processor of the Nook appears to be vastly underpowered, and each instruction you give the touchscreen results in a wait that seems interminable.  It took me 30 seconds, AFTER I got good at it, to highlight 3 lines at the bottom of a page.  Simply not acceptable.Battery life:  might have just been my own unit, but in 7 hours: dead.  I also experienced two full scale lockups, with all buttons simply refusing to work for several minutes.The Nook's only advantage, as far as I can tell, is access to significantly more free content than you can currently access on Kindle.  Not worth the incredible frustration of wrestling with a device that went for touchscreen technology, but forgot that the touchscreen needs to be FUNCTIONAL before you bring it to market.Update as of 2/11/2010:  I purchased a Kindle after returning my Nook, and have been using it for three days.  Wow.  What an incredible difference in terms of ease of use.  The keyboard is very functional, bookmarking and note taking is effortless, the dictionary function (move the cursor to a word, instantly a definition pops up) is wonderful. Battery consumption is imperceptible, after 3 day, no visible drain (my Nook lasted 7 hours).  Downside of the Kindle?  Books whose copyright had expired (e.g. Wuthering Heights)that were FREE on Nook, are 99 cents on Kindle.  Nook lists all vendors of a given book, with prices conveniently visible, Kindle does not.  Irritating.  Lastly, Nook had a tiny clock in a corner of the screen, which I found very useful.  Not available on Kindle.

566,1400599997,"[1, 2]",5.0,"I did a lot of research on the different ebook Readers before purchasing my NOOK.  I went back and forth between Amazon's Kindle and B&N's NOOK.  The thing that sold me on the NOOK was the ability to download books from other sources than just Amazon.  I can download books from my local library, Google Books, along with Barnes & Noble's selection of over 2 million books they offer.  The ability to download any ePub and PDF files is a plus.  I like the touch pad vs. keyboard on Kindle.  It took a little getting used to as it is very touch sensitive, but once I got the hang of it, it is a smooth way to navigate.  One of the criticisms of NOOK has been some sluggishness with the NOOK, which I have maybe a tiny bit of, but we're talking maybe a second or so, so it is no big deal really.  There have been many criticisms about the battery life of the NOOK, but to me it's a minor thing as all I have to do is plug it in about every 4 or 5 days if I use my NOOK excessively.  It lasts longer if the WiFi is turned off.  I can go a week without having to recharge it then.  I also like the ability to replace the battery myself rather than having to send the the entire Kindle in to have it replaced.  One of the nicest features of the NOOK is being able to go into my local B&N bookstore and talking to a real live person if I have any questions or have any problem with my NOOK.  B&N has NOOK stations right in their stores with people who are there to answer questions or help with problems you may encounter.  They are very helpful.  The Kindle does not offer that kind of service.

567,1400599997,"[194, 199]",4.0,"Despite all of the negative reviews, I decided to take a chance and buy the nook, once I tested it out at my local B&N.; I loved the look and feel of this device and was looking forward to the convenience of buying more books without adding more clutter to my already cluttered bookcases. I read all of the pros and cons of owning a Kindle and compared it to the pros and cons of owning a nook. The nook won because of its versatility (epub format, book lending, etc).My nook arrived on January 28th. Since then, I've experienced one crash and had to figure out how to use the touchscreen so that I can flip the pages without having to use the arrow keys. The latter took some practice, but I eventually mastered it and have been enjoying this feature ever since. I've also read three books in the space of a week, which is a personal record for me, as it normally takes two weeks for me to read a single paperback, longer if I'm reading an ebook on an LCD screen.The eInk technology is fabulous. I can read all day (and do) without eyestrain. The letters are very crisp on a plain white background. Even better, you can adjust the font size from small to extra large. Not only that but the nook comes with several fonts: Amasis, Helvetica Neue and Light Classic. I'm happy with the Amasis as it resembles Times Roman.My only complaint so far is that I am not able to categorize my books into categories. At the moment, I'm forced to wade through my list until I find the book that I want to read. B&N; has already sent out an update, which is a good improvement over the old interface. While the touch interface can be a bit buggy (Sometimes you have to flick your finger more than once or use the arrow keys to turn the page.), I can turn pages in one second compared to the 2-3 seconds it would take with the original software. That wasn't a big deal until I received the upgrade.I also like what they've done with the bookmarks feature. Before, they had a strange numerical format for bookmarks. With this upgrade, it lists the page that you bookmarked, which is much nicer.I love how I can download samples of ebooks directly from my nook without having to rely on the B&N; site to do everything. Once you finish the sample, you have the option to buy. If you decide to buy the book, you will be taken to the last page you read so that you can continue from there. You can also archive the books that you've read directly from your nook with the press of a button, which helps manage your list.Sideloading my pdf ebooks onto my nook was an easy experience. However, you can't categorize your documents; you can only sort them by title or author.Another great aspect of owning a nook is that you can check out ebooks from your local libraries (see [...] for a list of libraries near you), sideload books that you have bought from Fictionwise and other ebook stores, and download free ebooks from either the B&N; site or Google Books. That's what ultimately sold me on the nook, the versatility and freedom to choose where I want to buy or download free ebooks. The nook is not proprietary, unlike the Kindle and the soon-to-be-released iPad.The interface is very easy to use. It comes with a manual that you can read on the device, or on the B&N; website. If you're still stuck on an issue, I found this great forum ([...]) with friendly people who can help you.I've yet to check out the Lend feature because my family and friends have yet to embrace this technology.Other than my issue with organization, I am really enjoying my nook. I'm looking forward to reading many books in the future, thanks to this wonderful device. Highly recommended.Side note: I agree with S. Dayton about the iPad. After reading a few ebooks on my iTouch and my Mac, I have to agree with him about the eyestrain. For casual surfing and watching video, LCD works fine.

569,1400599997,"[6, 6]",5.0,"After MONTHS of research for my first ereader I finally decided on the Nook. With all the buzz, I, of course, ran out to BN to see the Nook when it first came out and was incredibly disappointed at that time as it was painfully sluggish and I had almost crossed it off my list for purchase. However, I went back and saw it again at the store after about 6 weeks from my first viewing and what a difference! Barnes and Noble has made great strides. A friend showed me her Kindle and I got to play with it and I looked in stores and saw the Sony reader as well. Did MUCH research online as well on some of the others such as Jetbook Lite.As much as I LOVE Amazon and shop here more often than I probably should LOL. I decided on the Nook seeing the improvements that were already made in that short amount of time. What sealed the deal for me was the SD card option to expand memory AND you can change the battery yourself as opposed to having to send your device back over a simple battery change.I am not regretting my decision to go with the Nook at all. I have to admit that it did freeze up on me twice, BUT it only did that when I interrupted the charging process. So, I don't know exactly what caused that. No problems at all while reading. As far as reading on the Nook, its a great device. Downloading books is fast and simple to do. Page turning is fast now. Its a dream come true for an avid reader like me.The only con that I've noticed so far is battery life. I think its a huge stretch to say the battery lasts 10 days. However, the wi-fi turns itself off after being idle for a minute or so, so you don't have to manually turn it off. When you activate the menu, it will reconnect to the network. So, BN is making an effort to increase battery life without much manual interaction.I highly recommend the Nook.

570,1400599997,"[46, 49]",5.0,"I purchased a Kindle for my wife last Christmas. She loves it and uses it more than any other gift I ever purchased her. She was having so much fun with it I decided to get an ereader for myself but I was drawn more toward the Nook. I read so many bad reviews about the Nook I wasn't sure if I should get it or a Kindle or maybe something different with a touch screen and wireless connection. I thought about it for a few weeks and noticed that the reviews started getting better. I decided to go for it. I ordered it last Wednesday from B&N; and received it 2 days later. I am so happy I did. I didn't experience any of the the negatives I read about with exception that battery could stay charged longer. Talking about the battery, it's nice to know that you can change it yourself and at a much lessor expense than with a Kindle. I'll probably never need it but it's also nice to be able to add a memory card to hold more content. And the Nook just looks nicer in my opinion.The new update was released the same day I received my Nook and I updated the firmware the second day I had it and it runs even more smoother. I have been a gadget man all my life but this is my first touch screen device. I had no problems what-so-ever navigating the menus and the menus changed fast enough for me.My wife still loves her Kindle but I think she is a little jealous. She asked me why I didn't get her a Nook for Christmas.I was completely in the dark about ereaders until just 2 months ago. I know during my research I found people that were experiencing  problems and were unhappy with every reader I checked into. If you were putting off getting a Nook because of bad reviews, I would give them another look. There has been 2 firmware updates already that probably addressed many of the earlier concerns.

571,1400599997,"[2, 5]",2.0,"I am still waiting for the perfect ebook reader. I bought the Nook for these reasons: 1) It reads industry-standard ePub-format ebooks, 2) it's tightly integrated with the B&N; ebook store, 3) the ebooks are encrypted in a well-documented easily-understood format that is portable across multiple devices so they can be decrypted and read in, say, your iPad's Nook reader software, or even in a Sony Reader (with the very latest firmware), without having to be re-purchased because of DRM nonsense.The problem is that the Nook simply doesn't live up to its promise. The ""paper-white"" display is more an off-beige, and reflects light in a way that makes it hard to read with a reading light (necessary because it has no backlight, as is true for all ePaper devices). It's heavy and the buttons to change pages are hard to push, especially with gloved hands as you might have while reading outdoors on a cool day. The ""5 day battery life"" in reality for me has been a 1-day battery life, read a book, and it needs to be recharged, and be darn sure to turn it off. The thing freezes up and crashes all the time even with the very latest software, and is excruciatingly slow even with the very latest software. The latest software added classifications for the ebooks so you could sort them into pseudo-folders, which is necessary given how excruciatingly slow the Nook is to scroll through its book list (get about 50 books on the list and you're in for major pain), but the clunky way they implemented this makes those of us who've gotten used to modern user interfaces frown and shake our heads.Sad to say, I really can't recommend any current eBook reader. Either they're too clumsy to use (Nook), have no books available for them (Sony), or have a proprietary eBook format that locks you into a single vendor (Kindle). I'm seriously considering buying an iPad, yes, it will only work for 9 hours or so on a battery charge, but that's true of the Nook too in real actual use and the iPad is usable for a lot of other things too. It's just disappointing that I can't get an ePaper-based reader that meets my criteria (non-proprietary ebook format, long battery life, compact, decent user interface), and instead have things either crippled by bad design decisions or crippled by having a proprietary ebook format that locks you into a single vendor.

Then one of my coworkers showed me her Kindle and I was able to play with it and look at it.Then the i pad came out, So I went to the store and looked at the i pad and played with it as well. I have read review after review and watched you-tube...Well The holidays came and my husband bought me the Nook!!! I was so excited! I wanted the Nook as soon as I saw it, but took my time and compared it to other e readers.. I knew right from the start which e reader I wanted after being in discussion with others about e readers and after looking and playing with a few of them.Right out of the box the Nook, made me happy and gave me confirmation of my long desire to own the Nook. My husband knew that I wanted it, but I waited trying to justify why I needed an e reader and to see if anyone of them would go beyond my expectations. The Nook did exactly that! For me the Nook was worth the money and time it took to decide on which one to purchase... Here is why I love the Nook, I can lend books to other, I can download from my library which is so awesome! I can surf the net for FREE!!!!!! no monthly fees like the i pad, It fits in my computer bag, purse, which makes it so easy to take with me, It has my favorite games, Chess and Sukodu! It was easy for me to download a ebook that I already have, but have been unable to read due to me not wanting to tote my lap top around, the book loaded right from my lap top to the Nook in no time... The amount of free books that are available to the Nook, and the daily free treats from Barnes And Nobles! Which will more than pay for the Nook over time. Being able to call Barnes and Nobles and talk to a live person over the phone and being able to walk in the store and get face to face customer service.I also like the fact that when you are in the store you can read ebooks for free for an hour and download more free ebooks! For me It was the right choice for our family, as when we go to Barnes and Nobles with our children we can stay longer now that we have the nook and can receive free treats and more free ebooks! It pays for itself... These are some of the reason why I love my nook and I am excited that I received the Nook for a gift! I can not say enough about the Nook, I don't have to be tied to one book store like Itunes, Ibook, are the Kindle store... I don't like limits and the Nook allows me to be free to choose where to get my books from...Now with that said, When I visited my local Barnes and Nobles and received a free smoothie, It was so stress free and everyone was so nice.. I could not believe it!I have also downloaded music that I can listen to and have my ear plugs for that, I have also downloaded several books which was so easy to download that I was shocked! I like getting my monies worth, and not having to pay extra monthly fees.Now with that said, I hope that when you do your research you will consider the Nook, I am surprised that there are not more reviews than the current number of reviews. Well back to my Nook, as I can not put it down!What a great gift, and a great buy!!!",2010-12-27,A2OKCS5234ZV7S,Flower,Wow worth every bit!,1293408000.0,0.6666666666666666,2010,12,3322.0,20,first let say nook first came market caught eye begin research e reader even went store tested nook played went store e reader looked well one coworkers showed kindle able play look pad came went store looked pad played well read review review watched tube well holiday came husband bought nook excited wanted nook soon saw took time compared e reader knew right start e reader wanted discussion others e reader looking playing right box nook made happy gave confirmation long desire nook husband knew wanted waited trying justify needed e reader see anyone would go beyond expectation nook exactly nook worth money time took decide one purchase love nook lend book download library awesome surf net free monthly fee like pad fit computer bag purse make easy take favorite game chess sukodu easy download ebook already unable read due wanting tote lap top around book loaded right lap top nook time amount free book available nook daily free treat barnes noble pay nook time able call barnes noble talk live person phone able walk store get face face customer service also like fact store read ebooks free hour download free ebooks right choice family go barnes noble child stay longer nook receive free treat free ebooks pay reason love nook excited received nook gift say enough nook tied one book store like itunes ibook kindle store like limit nook allows free choose get book said visited local barnes noble received free smoothie stress free everyone nice could believe also downloaded music listen ear plug also downloaded several book easy download shocked like getting monies worth pay extra monthly fee said hope research consider nook surprised review current number review well back nook put great gift great buy,wow worth every bit

I researched ALOT of ereaders before making the decision to buy the Nook; in fact, I originally bought a Kindle from a local store, but never took it out of the box, and returned it to purchase the Nook.I originally decided to go with the 3G for two reasons; 1) I wasn't sure I could set up my home wi-fi to work with the Nook, and 2) I wanted to be able to purchase books from absolutely anywhere.  And I've been glad I chose that; I have yet to purchase a book over just the wi-fi.  I was at a doctors office recently, waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was wonderful to be able to shop, buy a book, and start it while enduring the endless waiting.The customer service from Barnes and Noble is great, all I have to do is walk in the store with my Nook and the employees are knowledgable and helpful for helping with the Nook.  Also, the store nearest me has ""classes"" on Saturday afternoons for Nook/NookColor owners, and I found that to be very helpful when I first purchased my Nook.Speaking of the physical store, I also like that I can read any book for FREE for up to an hour a day in the store.  That gives me the opportunity to read alot more of a book than just what they provide as a ""free sample"" and lets me decide whether to purchase the book or not.I've looked at the newest generation Nook, which has just recently become available, and I'm glad I got my Nook when I did; I like it so much better than ANY ereader I've looked at.

576,1400599997,"[1, 2]",5.0,"I have been super happy with this reader.  In the bright sun sitting outside, no problem.  On the many flights I take, no problem.  B&N; site and downloading books is a breeze.  I've got a Droid X phone, and the accounts sync, so I can quickly pull up the same book on my phone with the Nook App, very cool.I can lend, and have others lend me, some of the books purchased.Our local library in Central Texas, outside Austin, is connected to Overdrive.com.  With my library card I can download epub books and check them out, anywhere I've got internet.  I don't have to check them back in, they just go away after the check out period.  Same with Audiobooks.  Nook handles this format, other eReaders do not, so you might want to look into this option and what formats the readers have before making a decision.I like the onscreen keyboard/touch screen, personally.  It is bright and easy in areas where dimly lit and the light in your reader case is directed at the reading screen.  Seems like no big deal, but after 28 hours on a plane you get tired and this makes a difference.Not a bunch of keys to hit/press with the keyboard exposed.  This is a personal opinion, and I can absolutely understand why others may want the keyboard.  I put in pagemarks etc on books, but don't type a lot of notes into the ebooks when reading.  If you do a lot of this, you may want to test run the onscreen keyboard and see if you like it.  I don't, the amount of typing is very limited, so onscreen is perfect and I'm used to it with my phones.Using this over wifi to surf the internet is something you can do, but it isn't the best.  You can in a pinch, but it's easier for me to pull out my smartphone and crank into a website.The number of places to get books, especially free ones, is awesome with the Nook handling so many formats.  B&N; just search 0.00 and titles and you'll get thousands of classics come up that copyright is over and they are free.  gutenberg.org is puts free classics by the tens of thousands out that you can download onto your Nook for free, google books does this and a few other sites.  Tons and Tons of books for free, I haven't read Tom Sawyer in 20+ years and am now, for free.  Just an addition to note.Lots of periodicals, newspapers etc, that you can get daily.I take my kids into B&N; and they love to look through the kids books.

577,1400599997,"[8, 13]",3.0,"Most of the other reviews have the details about what is good and bad in their opinion, and most of it is accurate. The battery life is misrepresented by B&N.; The only way you could possibly get 10 days out of the battery is if it is off. However, 2 to 4 days is a real possibility, So, bring your charger or USB to computer cable. Just like Apple IPOD, the B&N; folks decided to use a non-standard USB cable that appears to match the Apple ones. This is a minor problem, but do not expect to borrow a USB cable from someone while on travel. The included small charger worked very well.The key thing is how does the NOOK function as a book reader. In my opinion, it is adequate, and no more. I downloaded a number of free books without any problem. I also downloaded some paid books form B&N.; Once again, no problem. Finally, I downloaded some books from my public library onto my computer (not the NOOK)using the free Adobe software. Using the USB cable to my NOOK, I simply dragged the books to the NOOK, and voila, two seocnds later they were available for 14 days. So far so good. One could now rant about the interface (so-so), or the fact that you should reduce the color-screen brightness to about 10% to save the battery as well as turn off the WI-FI when not in use, and so forth, but how does it work when reading a book.If you are like me, and read fairly fast, most books will be a real page turners, since there is not much on a page compared to a real print on paper book. The print is clear. It is faily black on a slightly grey background (some might say off-white), which under a bright reading light is quite comfortable. For the eyesight challenged, there are bigger fonts accompanied with still more page turning. The same is true of the KINDLE. Page turning is easy and intuitive, so not a problem. Use the buttons on the side, not the color interface.A big feature of the NOOK is the ability to add a memory card. Well it is true you can do this, but it is not for the faint of heart or fingernail impaired. The first time you try to open the NOOK using the nearly invisible tab, you will wonder if you are going to break the cover. Just be careful, follow the instructions, and all will be well. Now, why would you want to add memory. As it arrives, the NOOK holds a huge number of books. You might want to add some of your work in PDF documents - this chews up space fast - and the pdf reading capability is primitive at best. Get a small netbook for this purpose and leave the NOOK for books. Changing the battery-RIGHT! Perhaps at the end of life, 2 to 3 years, to save a service trip. By then the technology will be antique, and you will replace the whole NOOK, not just the battery.A disappointment is the lack of even a primitive browser so that you could check email without lugging along another computer. The KINDLE has this feature. The NOOK can be ""upgraded"" to also have a browser, but then it is non-standard, and you might have trouble as B&N; upgrades the official firmware. Perhaps B&N; will relent and give us email capability similar to the APPLE I-Touch. I can understand not wanting to overload AT&T; with too much traffic, but simple text emails should not have been a problem.Finally, why would you want a NOOK in the first place. Remember, real books use no power, are truly random access, can be lent to anyone for as long as you like, and will function far into the future regardless of technology changes. The only purpose I can see for having a NOOK is for travel and for electronically borrowing books from a library without getting into your car or walking overmuch. Well, scratch the last, since you can borrow and read books on your computer. The airplane travel or train commute is a biggie. Books are heavy and bulky. Carrying 6 books onto an airplane is a pain. Plus, hauling out your NOOK to read makes you look technically COOL, and for the short term, is sure to start a conversation with a nearby stranger. The conversation might be interesting and better than the NOOK-book you were going to read.Well, I've written enough and am going to read a book that I just downloaded from the local library.

578,1400599997,"[0, 0]",3.0,"I bought the original nook in Aug. 2010. Initially, I liked it, but I quickly learned that the battery life wasn't nearly the quoted time (it lasts about 2 days for me, 3 max with wireless off and the most power-saving settings). The e-ink/lcd screen mix was nice for navigation, although I understand that the newer touch models will be more battery-efficient. Despite this drawback, it was so much more convenient than paperbacks. As much as I love the feel of books, in a NYC apartment, there just isn't all that much room for them!That nook lived for about 9 months until a part of the screen died - just black pixels. I called customer service and after a long painful process, got it replaced. The unit I got was clearly a refurbished unit, which wouldn't have bothered me, had it been identical to the one I sent it. My original nook had a two-part screen, this new nook had a one-part screen and its' buttons squeaked when pressed. Little did I know at the time that this was the sign of a very important defect! As it happened, this 'squeaking', which made the buttons difficult to press, also caused the page-turn buttons to crack just one month past warranty. Needless to say, I wasn't delighted. Apparently, the page-turn buttons cracking is a very common defect. So if you buy a nook, remember this: if the button squeaks and is hard to press, it will break. Return it while you can. Not all the nooks are like this (my old one wasn't), so I recommend checking it out.Overall - 3/5 - it's a solid reading device but doesn't really compare to the new-generation nook simple touch/kindle touch devices or even the Kindle 3 keyboard (which I now also own).",2011-11-27,A1BDZE0TP6L492,Juniper,Nice device but battery and Customer Service problems,1322352000.0,0.0,2011,11,1666.0,53,bought original nook aug initially liked quickly learned battery life nearly quoted time last day max wireless power saving setting e ink lcd screen mix nice navigation although understand newer touch model battery efficient despite drawback much convenient paperback much love feel book nyc apartment much room nook lived month part screen died black pixel called customer service long painful process got replaced unit got clearly refurbished unit bothered identical one sent original nook two part screen new nook one part screen button squeaked pressed little know time sign important defect happened squeaking made button difficult press also caused page turn button crack one month past warranty needless say delighted apparently page turn button cracking common defect buy nook remember button squeak hard press break return nook like old one recommend checking overall solid reading device really compare new generation nook simple touch kindle touch device even kindle keyboard also,nice device battery customer service problem
579,1400599997,"[3, 3]",3.0,"I bought a Nook today. The one and only reason I chose Nook (instead of just sticking with and upgrading my beloved old Kindle 1) is its ability to download books from the public library. Tomorrow I am taking the Nook back to Best Buy for a refund, not an exchange. The Nook is attractive and nicely packaged. I completely expected it to just work, like my Kindle did (and still does) and all of my Apple products do. But, like so many other reviewers here, my Nook never even got up and running before it croaked. First, it would not complete the registration process. I have an active account on B&N; and strong WiFi in my home, plus this Nook also has 3G so there were not any connection problems. Then, when I decided to just register later and moved on to explore how the Nook worked, it froze. Could not reboot or turn it off by holding down power key as suggested in the troubleshooting help/support on the B&N; website. It did not work. I do not want to mess with taking the back off, using little screwdrivers or whatever to take out (the fully charged) battery, etc. We should not have to do that on a brand new 200.00 product! So, am taking it back and won't buy another until they improve the quality of the thing. I never had one bit of trouble with my trusty Kindle, and would not even be looking at another brand of reader except for Kindle's inability to download library books.  I'm giving the Nook two stars instead of one because, if it actually worked, it looks like it would be a nice ereader and it has a more open format than Kindle does.Update: 1/28/11Went to return the Nook for a refund today and at the last minute decided to give it another go, so did exchange instead. Tonight charged and powered up the replacement Nook, so far so good. It works perfectly. Registration was smooth and fast, wifi connected easily with my signal, downloaded a book quickly, and navigation is a breeze.  No problems encountered yet except that it is not downloading an available firmware update, and there's probably some explanation for that so not a big deal.  So, I might just end up keeping this baby as a companion to my Kindle. Love having the Nook with its open format for library and other downloads. Will see how it holds up over the next several weeks and then update my rating accordingly.Update: 2/3/11Returned the Nook to Best Buy today and bought a Kindle 3 through Amazon. After exchanging the first defective Nook then using its replacement for several days I found that the device worked pretty much as it was supposed to. There are a couple of minor things about it that I was not crazy about and probably would have gotten used to, but there is one problem (design flaw?) that for me is definitely a deal killer. One of the minor annoyances is that there is a lot of screen flash during any menu change. Another is that the color, lighted touch screen control at the bottom of the device is distracting when it lights up at any touch during reading. And after a while I was not that crazy about the menu navigation either, seemed like too many steps and screen flashes, but probably could have gotten used to that too. I would not have rejected the Nook just over those little quirks. The big reason that the Nook was no way going to work out for me is, again, that touch screen display at the bottom of the device. It is, like an iPad, highly reflective. So what that means is that when the screen is off, which it is most all of the time during reading, you can watch yourself read! The black screen reflects anything in front of it, almost like a dark mirror. That was a no go for me, no I did not like it at all. Aside from these annoyances, the Nook did well at everything it was designed to do. So will upgrade the rating to reflect (haha) that. I have to say that I am much happier with the Kindle, but Amazon really needs to get with the program and let Kindle use the epub format. They will eventually lose me and a lot of other prospective customers over the epub problem, it is that big of a deal.Yet another update! 5/31/11Caved in and purchased another Nook last week. I still love my Kindle and prefer it over Nook, but just could not wait another minute for Amazon to open Kindle to ePub for downloading public library books. So, last week when B&N; had Nooks for sale cheap on their eBay website (99.00, free ship, 3g/wifi, non-color, refurb w/ full warranty) I jumped on it. This refurb Nook worked much better out of the box than my initial brand new device purchased then returned back in Jan/Feb. I am using the Nook just for library books, and it does what it's supposed to do. Navigation works well, but seems like it requires more step than Kindle. Still do not like the reflective color screen below the reading area. There is one thing that I do like better on Nook, the screen background is a paler gray than Kindle making for easier reading in low light. I will keep this Nook until Amazon does ePub, then stick with Kindle.",2011-01-27,A2IAD8XA81CQWQ,kare777,Kindle lover jumps ship for a few hours,1296086400.0,1.0,2011,1,4981.0,39,bought nook today one reason chose nook instead sticking upgrading beloved old kindle ability download book public library tomorrow taking nook back best buy refund exchange nook attractive nicely packaged completely expected work like kindle still apple product like many reviewer nook never even got running croaked first would complete registration process active account b n strong wifi home plus nook also g connection problem decided register later moved explore nook worked froze could reboot turn holding power key suggested troubleshooting help support b n website work want mess taking back using little screwdriver whatever take fully charged battery etc brand new product taking back buy another improve quality thing never one bit trouble trusty kindle would even looking another brand reader except kindle inability download library book giving nook two star instead one actually worked look like would nice ereader open format kindle update went return nook refund today last minute decided give another go exchange instead tonight charged powered replacement nook far good work perfectly registration smooth fast wifi connected easily signal downloaded book quickly navigation breeze problem encountered yet except downloading available firmware update probably explanation big deal might end keeping baby companion kindle love nook open format library downloads see hold next several week update rating accordingly update returned nook best buy today bought kindle amazon exchanging first defective nook using replacement several day found device worked pretty much supposed couple minor thing crazy probably would gotten used one problem design flaw definitely deal killer one minor annoyance lot screen flash menu change another color lighted touch screen control bottom device distracting light touch reading crazy menu navigation either seemed like many step screen flash probably could gotten used would rejected nook little quirk big reason nook way going work touch screen display bottom device like ipad highly reflective mean screen time reading watch read black screen reflects anything front almost like dark mirror go like aside annoyance nook well everything designed upgrade rating reflect haha say much happier kindle amazon really need get program let kindle use epub format eventually lose lot prospective customer epub problem big deal yet another update caved purchased another nook last week still love kindle prefer nook could wait another minute amazon open kindle epub downloading public library book last week b n nook sale cheap ebay website free ship g wifi non color refurb w full warranty jumped refurb nook worked much better box initial brand new device purchased returned back jan feb using nook library book supposed navigation work well seems like requires step kindle still like reflective color screen reading area one thing like better nook screen background paler gray kindle making easier reading low light keep nook amazon epub stick kindle,kindle lover jump ship hour
580,1400599997,"[16, 17]",4.0,"There are a multitude of reviews that compare and contrast the Nook and Kindle, so I'm not going to go into a full-blown comparison and review. I'm going to focus on my experience owning both, most specifically battery life and availability of books.My husband uses the kindle and I use the Nook. The reason I went with the Nook is because initially I was very ""anti"" non-paper book. He wanted a kindle and I sneered at the idea. I was being a book snob and didn't like the idea of books in electronic format, so I snubbed my nose at it.However, after we took a vacation and he had his kindle loaded with books, and I had 8-10 big paper books, I began to reconsider my position.  Upon return from our vacation I elected to get a Nook. I did so because I liked the idea of the touch screen at the bottom rather than the keyboard, which I thought made the kindle look klunky. I thought overall that the Nook was more aesthetically pleasing. So - I ordered the nook.There are two major things that the kindle has on the Nook, and that is far superior battery life, and significantly more books available for download - especially so if you read non-fiction.The battery life on my Nook is awful. So much so that I ordered a new battery thinking perhaps I had a dud. Nope - it's performance is just the same. If I am actively reading a book I have to recharge  every 3 days. If I don't read it for 10-14 days it will drain on it's own. Comparing this to my husband's kindle, he can go an entire 2 week trip reading books daily without having to recharge his kindle! It takes a couple months to drain with no usage. The kindle's battery life is mega-much more than my Nook. I have serious battery life envy. For that alone I've begun to covet his kindle.The second bummer is that most of the available books for Nook are fiction. There are some of the more popular non-fiction type books available. Usually whatever is most trendy at the time, but for the most part any professional type texts, or anything not on a best seller list that is non-fiction can't be found for the Nook platform. However, when I go to Amazon, 8 of 10 times, I'll find it available for download on the kindle.BUT! One thing about this is that for me, I tend to mark up and highlight my non-fiction books a lot because I'm using them for reference sources. It is very difficult to quickly retrieve highlighted text from the electronic source compared to my real, paper books. So I've actually come to realize that I'd likely be purchasing my non-fiction as real paper books anyways, so that I can have them for ready reference and mark them up with my highlights and little flags (yes - I'm a geek who uses the little flag tabs to mark pages in my books!) So, I'm now fine with the fact that I can't readily download non-fiction to my Nook and instead I continue to buy them as regular, paper books. As I said above, I'd likely buy my non-fiction as real books anyways since I use them as references.I now download all my fiction books to the Nook. So it's become my source for pleasure reading, which is great, since that is the kind of stuff I take with me when I travel or about town anyways, and can just stuff the Nook in my purse.However, I VERY MUCH ENVY THE BATTERY LIFE OF THE KINDLE!

582,1400599997,"[16, 17]",5.0,"Pros: eInk display preserves traditional reading experience and has great clarity and contrast. Reads PDF (both scanned and standard text) and EPUB book formats with no hassles or conversion required. In-store help and extra features from B&N.; Page turning speed is much improved with most recent update. Android OS allows for almost unlimited software improvements and added features. Replacement batteries can be bought and installed easily. Accepts SD cards for increased storage capacity (this really comes in handy if you want to use the device as an mp3 player or for audiobooks).Cons: eInk display requires you to operate at a bit slower pace than the touchscreen alone would allow. (Also: Not sure why the price from this supplier is abnormally high?)I've played with an iPad and it's a very fun device. But what I don't like is a glowing backlit screen, as I look at a monitor all day. When I read, I want to relax and give my eyes a break, and that's why I prefer eInk displays.The Nook's primary advantage over the Kindle is that it allows you to read EPUB and PDF books (scanned or text; either works) and buy books from various online ebook stores, including the Sony Reader store. This has already allowed me to read two titles that I wouldn't have been able to get for the Kindle. It also works very easily with Adobe Digital Editions software, a huge plus. Currently Amazon offers some titles that B&N; does not (a very temporary state of affairs, I suspect), but those are usually available from Sony.Add the book loan feature, free library books, and the ability to take it to a B&N; store for bonus features, and this unit pretty much stomps the Kindle and Sony readers.The Nook is a little slower than a phone or your other electronic devices due to the e-Ink screen, but once you get used to it, the device seems very smooth. In fact, I find that having to slow down a little actually helps me relax, and once you master turning pages with a quick brush of the thumb across the touchscreen, reading with the Nook is a very pleasant experience.

I have downloaded books from the local public library using OverDrive and Adobe Digital Edition and all have come through perfectly.  Downloading books from B & N have been quick and efficient.  I like being able to Find/Search forward and backward and to be able to look up words easily.  I have used bookmarks and highlights as well.  I also like the feature of being able to go to Last Read Page or to quickly pick a page using the Go To.  I have downloaded my own wallpaper and screen savers.  The two reasons I chose the Nook over the Kindle:  local support at Barnes and Noble and the ability to borrow ebooks from the public library.

584,1400599997,"[9, 12]",5.0,"I will continue to update this review as I discover new features of the Nook, so stay tuned folks!*****************************************************************************Updated 02/08/2010*****************************************************************************I've been using my Nook with the newest update (v 1.2) for a few days now.  This is the second update to the Nook since launch.  All I can say is THANK YOU Barnes & Noble!The LCD screen improvements alone are GREAT!  With better looking icons, more responsiveness, and a sleeker appearance -- it makes me think of that McDonald's commercial: I'm lovin' it!Several of the well documented issues have been fixed, such as losing bookmarks due to powering off the unit -- which as it turns out was the most cited problem for Nook bashers and haters alike.  Nook haters will also be disappointed that the battery life has been optimized too.All-in-all if you've been waiting for the minor 1.0 issues to be fixed prior to purchasing the Nook you will not be disappointed in this newest version.  And if you have been considering switching from the Kindle you would be well advised to do so at this point.*****************************************************************************Updated 01/31/2010*****************************************************************************This device is clearly the best option on the market today, with it's LCD touchscreen, Wi-fi, memory expansion capabilities, and so, so much more. Let's ""wade in the weeds"" and look at some of the features in detail:LCD TouchscreenSo far this is the only mainstream reader to offer a LCD screen of any kind. The Coverflow-like book cover listing is beautiful, elegant, and functional. With the newest update it is uber fast, intuitive, and responsive. Page turns are super easy with the touchscreen, all you have to do is swipe the screen with one finger when it's in standby mode and the page turns.  In addition, it's easier for me to navigate books via the LCD than textually. Seeing the cover is a really nice feature, since books are designed to pique your interest by the cover. It just seems like a good cover sells a book, and seeing that cover in crisp LCD sells me from time to time.The keyboard is nice, any time a text field comes up you will have the keyboard pop up on queue. It's fast, responsive, and best of all doesn't look like a 1970's era fax machine keypad like some of the older readers on the market.Wi-fiThe built in Wi-fi is one of the great features of this device. Modern 3G speeds are pretty fast, but as most of us know that have smartphones, Wi-fi is about 100 times faster, especially when one tries to download large things, or a lot of content. The Wi-fi on this device is no exception... it's fast and super easy to set up. The on screen instructions are sooo clear to follow. I couldn't imagine only having 3G these days, like when you are in an area that doesn't have 3G coverage, you can still use the Nook over Wi-fi.  This is truly one of the killer features of the Nook.  You can go into a B&N; store and Wi-fi to your hearts content, but then come home and do the same.  Hotels offering free Wi-fi are the Nooks biach.Memory ExpansionThe Nook has a Micro-SD card slot which accepts up to 16GB Micro-SD cards, this allows you to upgrade your memory indefinitely. Another advantage would be to organize your books. And books on the card are never going to get lost if your reader dies -- without having to re-download from the cloud.  Plus with the new B&N; desktop reader you can move your books from the Nook to a laptop/netbook on the fly, and what if the worst should happen and your eReader dies?  You still have those books on the card.AppearanceThis is a biggy for me as it is for most people... I don't tend to buy or use things that look ugly. That's why I've got an iPod instead of a Zune, why I've got a LCD TV instead of a CRT, and now why I've got a Nook instead of another reader. The appearance of this device can be described with one word, SEXY. It just looks good. Other readers currently available range from looking ""not too bad"" to looking downright ugly. This reader is the exception to that rule and employs a host of features to boot.Book formats and availabilityThis is probably the biggest of all the features, since we are talking about a book reader, the Nook boasts a whopping 1,000,000 books available for it, in readily readable format, from just two sources (B&N; and Google). The nearest competitor only offers 500,000 books in it's native format (Kindle). You can convert many books to a Kindle readable format, but it's a hassle and you have to use your computer to do that. Sort of defeats the purpose of the wireless if you have to constantly connect to the PC. And there are third party sources for books in Kindle format, probably websites you've never heard of, new sites pop up all the time since Kindle has a big install base, but the quality of books on those sites is in question compared to a reputable company like Google.eInk displayIt seems to be crisper than much of the competition out there. The ability to change the typeface and size of the fonts is wonderful. The nearest competitors screen almost seems fuzzy in comparison, which for me makes it harder to read. Page changes are fast on the Nook, while nothing can compare with the speed of changing a real books' page, it's fast enough for the average person. Speed readers may find themselves waiting for a few milliseconds though. The controls on the Nook are straightforward and intuitive.Replacable batteryThis is another biggy for most ebook people, with the Nook you can change the battery out should you A) want extended reading times without charge, or B) if the original battery dies for some reason.  Many of the other readers on the market do not allow this, which means they are bricked if the battery dies and will either have to be repaired or replaced.Battery lifeA lot has been said about the battery life of the Nook, and other eReaders.  All of the manufacturers of these devices overstate the real world battery life in real world useage situations.  I have a co-worker with one of the Amazon (Kindle Brand) eReaders and he has to charge every 3 - 4 days.  Nook lasts for me about 5 - 7 days, but it all depends on what features you use on either or any of the devices and how much you use them to determine actual, real world battery usage. Either way, all of these devices are easy to charge.  Just plug into a standard 110 - 120 outlet and PRESTO!  Or in the case of the Nook, you can also plug into your computer/laptop/netbook and VOILA!  You will be on go in no time flat.Ease of useThe Nook is easy to set up and use, The onscreen keyboard is more familiar and similar to modern devices than many of the competitors setups.SummaryThere are so many features of this device it's hard to capture them all in one review. All in all this is one great device, with it's iPod like look and feel, large number of built in features, and industry standard operating system, it's clearly the choice of discerning electronics customers.*******************************Update*******************************So, I had been told on these comments that the B&N; in store functionality was not ready to be used yet -- another lie dispelled today.  I stopped in at the B&N; in Hillsboro and it is in fact fully functional.  My Nook immediately recognized the B&N; network and connected without me even having to tell it to!

585,1400599997,"[26, 42]",5.0,"The Nook is the best e-reader yet. It replaces the keyboard on the Kindle with a color touch screen about the size of the iPhone display. This makes it easy to maneuver between  the store, your library, your current book, the daily (with messages, newsletters, and other free content), and settings. The LCD display changes from menu items to images of book covers to a keyboard as needed, and then turns off when reading.You can connect by both WiFI and free 3G to download a purchase in seconds, and connect with WiFi to get content and other offers when you walk into a B&N; store. I'm using the latest 1.1.1 SW release that fixes most of the issues noted in early reviews. Updates are done automatically over the air.The nook feels great in the hand with a slightly contoured back that adds a little thickness for the hand to grip. Controls are provided for equal usability by a left or right-hander person. The back is removable and replaceable with different colors. They are all rubber coated to make it less likely to drop. Unlike the Kindle the battery is replaceable and the memory is expandable. The e-ink display is the same type, but appears to be slightly crisper than the Kindle 2. The nook supports  EPUB (Non or Adobe DRM), PDB (Non DRM), PDF, Graphics: JPG, GIF, PNG, BMP, Audio: MP3, PDB. The online B&N; bookstore has about a million books compared to the Kindle store with half that, the major difference being the free public domain books provided by Google.Summary:While it costs the same as the Kindle, the nook is loaded with extra features: WiFi, color LCD, removable battery, expandable memory, more open book formats.

587,1400599997,"[1, 3]",4.0,"I already own a Wi-Fi + 3G Kindle and had compared reviews between the Nook and Kindle extensively, before buying the Kindle.  But because the Nook allows you to borrow books from the local library for free, and my wife was hogging the Kindle, I decided to try a Nook, at a reduced price.  While the Kindle is clearly a superior product, (lighter, faster, easier to use and much longer battery life), I found the Nook okay at the price I paid.It was a little difficult to learn how to navigate with the touch screen and the set-up seemed ponderous, but once I got the hang of it, I've borrowed a book a week from the library.  The reduced price for the product was because someone had returned it and it presumably had been repaired.  I haven't found anything wrong with it and it looked new, unscratched and unmarked, so as a back-up to a Kindle, I'd recommend it.

588,1400599997,"[2, 2]",4.0,"If i had known that the 3g is not good for anything except purchasing books (yes I know it is my fault for not doing more research), I would not have paid more for the 3g version as I don't need the ability to get books anytime anywhere.  The web browser only works on wifi.  Anyway, I really like the Nook. I bought a refurb from one of those daily deal sites for a very good price. I have only had it for about a week so I can't speak for it's reliability but I have loaded lots of free ebooks (what I bought it for) from various sources, some audio books for my kids, and some music.  I like the web browser and the sudoku game.  The only thing I would change if I could is to have an option to combine the ""my b&n library"" with ""my documents"" because when you get books from anywhere else besides B&N, it goes to your documents.  I would like to be able to pull up my ""mysteries"" shelf and be able to see all of my mysteries not just the ""documents"" set or the ""B&N"" set.  I think it would make it more user friendly to have that be an option (only an option since some people probably like it the way it is).  It's a bit heavier than I thought it would be but not unmanageable.

593,1400599997,"[9, 9]",4.0,"I got the Nook the day before Nook Color was announced. I actually waited until the Nook Color was announced before opening the box - I wanted to see what the new gadget had to offer and if it'd be worth trading mine in.There were some rumors that the Nook Color would feature a screen with Mirasol technology, and I was disappointed to learn that it actually had an LCD screen coated with something to reduce glare. I state at an LCD screen all day at work, and don't want to do the same while reading. Plus, I'm not sure how well the LCD screen would fare in the sun and I'm interested to hear feedback from Nook Color owners.I think the color screen matters if you want to read a lot of magazines, or textbooks, or kids' books, none of which I'll be doing. Nook Color also stores more books (6000) and allows the reader to send updates to Facebook and Twitter directly from the eReader. Personally, I didn't find any of these extra features particularly appealing, so I'm happily sticking with the original Nook.My Observations/Pros of the Nook-It's bigger than I expected, in a good way. It's not heavy, but has a nice ""significant"" feel to it.-I think few people realize how clear and book-like the e-Ink screen actually is. I showed the Nook to some friends, and that was the first thing they noticed.-The bottom LCD touch-screen adds a little oomph with the color buttons and book covers.-Getting ePub books from the public library has been surprisingly easy, although you have to connect the Nook to a computer in order to transfer the ePub files.-I've been enjoying the Nook Facebook group where administrators post a free eBook every Friday.-The instructional videos online are very helpful in getting started with the Nook.Cons-BN.com has a Free NookBooks section, but for some reason, not all the free eBooks are listed. I saw some Kindle titles that were available for free, and when I searched on BN.com, turns out they were free there as well.-I didn't care much about the LendMe feature of the Nook, but it was still disappointing to learn that not all purchased eBooks can be lent out. Publishers control which titles can be used for lending, and each book can only be lent out once....ever.-The PDF manual for the Nook is very confusing and can benefit from some serious editing.-There are definitely more Kindle books than NookBooks available, but I hope that will change in the near future.All in all, I am pretty happy with the Nook and I think the fact that it supports a wider range of eBook formats outweighs many of the cons. I like not being tied down to one proprietary format and being able to check out eBooks from the library is priceless to me.",2010-11-01,A3G7BEJJCPD6DS,VeraP,The Number of Formats Supported Outweigh the Cons,1288569600.0,1.0,2010,11,2675.0,49,got nook day nook color announced actually waited nook color announced opening box wanted see new gadget offer worth trading mine rumor nook color would feature screen mirasol technology disappointed learn actually lcd screen coated something reduce glare state lcd screen day work want reading plus sure well lcd screen would fare sun interested hear feedback nook color owner think color screen matter want read lot magazine textbook kid book none nook color also store book allows reader send update facebook twitter directly ereader personally find extra feature particularly appealing happily sticking original nook observation pro nook bigger expected good way heavy nice significant feel think people realize clear book like e ink screen actually showed nook friend first thing noticed bottom lcd touch screen add little oomph color button book cover getting epub book public library surprisingly easy although connect nook computer order transfer epub file enjoying nook facebook group administrator post free ebook every friday instructional video online helpful getting started nook con bn com free nookbooks section reason free ebooks listed saw kindle title available free searched bn com turn free well care much lendme feature nook still disappointing learn purchased ebooks lent publisher control title used lending book lent ever pdf manual nook confusing benefit serious editing definitely kindle book nookbooks available hope change near future pretty happy nook think fact support wider range ebook format outweighs many con like tied one proprietary format able check ebooks library priceless,number format supported outweigh con

603,1400698987,"[38, 42]",5.0,"I had given my kids a Nook Color a couple years ago. Sold it last fall and got 1 girl a Kindle Fire 2nd gen, and the other a Lenovo A2107. The Lenovo was absolutely horrid so I wanted to replace it. This summer, when the Nook HD got Google Play, and the prices fell, I sold the Lenovo and got my daughter the Nook HD 16gb Snow. She absolutely loves it! I liked it so much, I got the Nook HD 8gb for myself. I like it much better than my Kindle Fire HD. The size is smaller, and thinner, and lighter, which are great things. And you can put whatever wallpaper you want on it, unlike the Fire HD.I sold the 2nd gen Kindle Fire and gave the other daughter the Fire HD, but she has since switched to a Nook also (HD+). So now I have the Fire HD and the Nook HD for myself. I like the Nook HD better for the reasons stated above. Size and weight are so much smaller on the Nook HD. The screen resolution is also better. There is nothing I don't like about the Nook HD. I did put a GreatShield Glare Screen protector on the Nooks, to reduce the shiny glare. We use them without cases, just sleeves. They are phenomenal tablets.If you or the person you are buying for loves to play games and will likely download hundreds of them, definitely get the 16gb Nook HD. You will want as much space for apps as you can afford, despite the SD card slot. Games have to be installed to internal memory, for the most part. The SD card slot comes in handy for books, movies, photos and music. I got the 8 gb Nook HD for myself, because I don't play games, the only apps I need are for reading, playing music, news, web, stuff like that. I put my files on the SD card and I am set!I don't plan to buy the new Fires when they come out.  They are far too limited, in my opinion. (So was the Nook, of course, until they added Google Play). I have ADW Launcher on all three of the Nooks, though my daughters tend to prefer the standard Nook launcher. What shows up on that home page can be customized to show only what you want it to show. There is also an ""app drawer"" icon that shows the most recently opened apps for easy launching.

623,1400699169,"[0, 0]",5.0,"A year after Barnes and Noble dropped the price approximately one hundred dollars the Nook HD+ 9"" is still one of the best values in the tablet market.  The price is starting to creep up for a new one so keep your eyes open for a sale, but don't wait too long because they are no longer being manufactured.There are two primary reasons that I like the Nook HD+ 9"". First of course is the 1920 x 1280 high resolution display.  You will note that  by comparison 1080p is only 1920 x 1080 so this display is 4x3 not 16x9.  In my opinion the extra pixels make browsing web pages more pleasant in both portrait and landscape mode.  The second reason is that this tablet was sold in large numbers so developers have released ROM builds with the latest version of Android KitKat.  These can be used either by flashing the tablet's ROM internally or running KitKat from a micro SD Card and leaving the Nook's original operating system untouched.We have numerous Android devices and were able to download everything we needed for free, but their are companies who sell micro SD cards already set up for around $20.  So for a reasonable price one can get a ""rooted"" android tablet without doing much research and with almost no risk to the tablet or your warranty.This tablet was originally released in November of 2012.  It has a 1.5 GHz OMAP4470 Dual-Core Processor which is a little slower than the Samsung Exynos 4412 dual-core 1.5GHz processor found in the Galaxy Tab 3 8"" that was released in a few months later in mid 2013.  The processor is good enough to play most formats of HD Video, but struggles with games with 3D graphics.  It performs better with the rooted version of KitKat than with the stock Nook OS.We had a Galaxy Tab 3 8"" and now have a Galaxy Tab 4 8"".  They both have a very good GPS and cameras in the front and rear.  The Nook has neither of these features.  But the bigger display with 1920x1280 resolution as compared to 1280x800 on the Galaxy Tabs more than makes up for these shortcomings for most of what we use a tablet for.Many of these were sold so there is a very good support network.  Lots of accessories are available through Amazon and the other usual suspects.  The hardware has proven to be dependable despite a few people who have reported problems here.  They come with a good warranty and extended warranties are available.  I am giving it 5 stars not because it is the greatest tablet ever made, but because at this time at the prices they are going for on sale... it is the best tablet value that I am currently aware of.",2014-07-14,AYC7L2YJMZOOC,,Great Value!

I ordered my direct from B & N for $179.00.  It came pre registered in my wifes account who has the nook color.  It is very easy to create your own profile and not see all the junk your spouse has but, at the same time can pick what you want that they have.  No need to repurchase what they already have.What Barnes and Nobel doesn't really want you to know is that you can put Amazon's Kindle app on the nook and read Kindle books (both free and purchased from Amazon).  I also noted that, with the Kindle app, you can adjust the fonts and resize PDF documents that you cannot do on the nook when reading PDF's.Lets not forget its a 9 in screen.  Battery holds well at 10 hours.I bought a 32GB SD card and so far have put 15 movies ( and stiil room for many more) on the card to watch in HD. I choose to save the memory on the nook for books or other apps and watch my movies from the tiny SD micro card. Buy ""DVD Catalyst"" ( really cool program for $9.95)(can try it for free)on line to compress those movies from DVD and then it automatically puts it on the micro card.I seen some gripes about them adding Google store.  Not sure how you can complain about ading a whole another facet of apps.  IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN DON'T ADD ANY GOOGLE APPS. Its still a free country.So for reading ebooks, movies, games, apps and many others all for $179.00, for me it hit my tickle spot.

626,1400699169,"[0, 0]",5.0,"Well, I bought it because of the 1080p resolution.  The screen quality is beautiful.  I already have an Apple 4th generation iPad, but I couldn't resist on the high quality picture and low price.  After I received the Nook, I immediately rooted with Kit Kat, the latest operating system.  Let me tell you, I am glad that I made the move.  The original Ice Cream Sandwich OS has lag but not Kit Kat.  With Kit Kat, not only the Nook operates much more smoothly, you also get the full Android tablet experience and more apps available from Google Play.I recently stumbled across the XBMC Cine Player Android app in the Google Play store.  With this app, I can now stream over 1500 movies in HD quality for free.  I have been using XBMC for a little while now on both MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, though the Cine Player version's library is not as extensive as the MacBook Pro and Raspberry Pi, it is good enough for use when you are on the road like in a hotel or something.  With Kit Kat, I experience very little buffering issue. I can also output contents to a TV via the Nook HDMI adapter.  I believe you can output signal to a TV via Google Chromecast but I haven't tried it yet so I can't be for sure.I highly recommend the Nook if you root it with the latest OS.  I am finding more and more things that I can do with the Nook then the iPad due to Android is an open system.By the way, I use N2A to root my two Nook HD+'s.  With a N2A micro SD card, it gives you the dual boot capabilities.  You can use it to boot Kit Kat or the native Barnes and Noble OS without removing the card.  The N2A card doesn't replace the native OS as the Kit Kat OS is stored in the micro SD card so you don't have to be concerned about voiding the warranty from alternating the tablet OS.Bottom line, the Nook HD+ is already a pretty decent tablet.  One can greatly improve its potential with a simple change to the OS.  If front and back cameras and GPS are not necessities for you, the Nook is a good value tablet for 1/3 of the cost of an iPad.  By the way, I bought an external bluetooth GPS for $16 and it works like a charm with the Nook.  One can expect to spend $100 for an external bluetooth GPS if your IOS device doesn't come with an internal GPS.",2014-05-25,A2IQSNBMGS45X9,Annie Wong,Well worth every penny if rooted with Kit Kat,1400976000.0,0.0,2014,5,2244.0,45,well bought p resolution screen quality beautiful already apple th generation ipad resist high quality picture low price received nook immediately rooted kit kat latest operating system let tell glad made move original ice cream sandwich o lag kit kat kit kat nook operates much smoothly also get full android tablet experience apps available google play recently stumbled across xbmc cine player android app google play store app stream movie hd quality free using xbmc little macbook pro raspberry pi though cine player version library extensive macbook pro raspberry pi good enough use road like hotel something kit kat experience little buffering issue also output content tv via nook hdmi adapter believe output signal tv via google chromecast tried yet sure highly recommend nook root latest o finding thing nook ipad due android open system way use n root two nook hd n micro sd card give dual boot capability use boot kit kat native barnes noble o without removing card n card replace native o kit kat o stored micro sd card concerned voiding warranty alternating tablet o bottom line nook hd already pretty decent tablet one greatly improve potential simple change o front back camera gps necessity nook good value tablet cost ipad way bought external bluetooth gps work like charm nook one expect spend external bluetooth gps io device come internal gps,well worth every penny rooted kit kat

628,1400699169,"[57, 59]",5.0,"Review for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+A new winner in the ""best value in a mid-size Android tablet"" category.When it was originally introduced at around $270 it was a decent value in a mid-hi range tablet, but limited by the closed B&N; ecosystem.  Now that it is being offered at new prices ($150-180) and has been upgraded to support Google Play Android apps as well as B&N; content, the value proposition is much improved.  (Yes, you will have to be patient and let your Nook HD+ do a couple a major software updates before you can really settle down and enjoy your new toy!  But it's worth the wait.)If you are coming from other Nook devices, you'll feel right at home.  If not, you may be surprised to find the combined ""reader"" and ""Android tablet"" interface pretty nice.  It's well thought out and for the most part works very well.  Take your time and be willing to explore a bit and you'll soon get the hang if  it.  Don't miss the ""Nook Today"" icon which is a clever one, but easily overlooked.  All in all, I was very comfortable with it in a short time and actually find the UI a bit of a refreshing change.  (Occasionally, you have to use the home key instead of just ""back"" but a minor quibble.) [Note: You can ""override"" the Nook UI and install other ""launchers"" but I, personally, felt no need to do so.  But nice to know the option is there if ever needed.]The size is a nice compromise between the smaller units (too small for comfortable long video watching) and the larger units (big, heavy, bulky).  The 8-9"" range seems to be the sweet spot.  The FULL HD (1920x1080 256ppi) screen is gorgeous with great colors and contrast and sufficient brightness.  Videos/movies, YouTube, Photos, Graphics, all look great.  The high quality screen is the big draw here, in my opinion.  Excellent value at the new price point.The size, weight (very light for this size device), slimness, and easy handling are all good points of this tablet.  Some do not like the Nook hole on the bottom left, but I am fine with it.  It gives a bit of orientation, an easy place to grab the tablet, and so on.  The styling looks good to me and the slimness is nice and makes it easy to hold and handle.HD YouTube and Netflix look wonderful.  This is absolutely one of the best tablets for the price if you want to watch Netflix on the go.  I was able to hook up my portable bluetooth speakers without any problems, so the movies sounded great as well.  Bluetooth headphones also worked well as did regular headphones, of course.  The built in speaker(s) is OK, but not sufficient for best music and movie sound quality (as is true with most tablets).The controls are well placed, simple, and easy to use.  The MicroSD card slot is a nice bonus so you can expand your storage easily and is a feature missing from many tablets.  The proprietary charging port is a minus, a standard USB would have been more flexible, but it works well and charges faster.  The handy ""HOME"" button with the Nook logo is very useful and also works well.There are no cameras - and I could care less, but some might.  I'll take the superb screen, great design and build, and other nice features and be happy.  For the techies, it uses 1.5 GHz dual-core OMAP 4470 proc and 1 GB of RAM.  Not cutting edge, but plenty fast.  Benchmarks I checked were all pretty good and the Nook HD+ is very responsive in use. The back features a nice ""soft touch"" feel that I really like versus many tablets that have a slick back making them prone to being easily dropped.The recent update adds the Chrome browser to the NOOK HD+ and web browsing is snappy and works well.  Everything looks great, of course, on the FULL HD screen and the Chrome browser handles most web pages with aplomb, formatting them nicely for the Nook HD+.  Chrome will also sync and update your bookmarks and such across devices, automatically, which is nice.If you like Barnes & Noble and their books and movie content, then, of course, that is a win for you as well.  It's all here and well integrated.  Plus there are some Nook HD+ specific apps pre-installed and you should prefer them in most cases.  (Note: I made the mistake of updating the Nook Netflix app with the one from the Google Play store -- big No-No!  It did not work at all.  Once I uninstalled it and went back and reloaded the Nook-branded version from the Nook store (free) -- everything worked fine again. I've had this issue with other tablets as well, the Netflix app seems to be very picky and you need the right one for your specific tablet. I had also installed the Android Pandora over the Nook version, but that one worked fine.  So...if you do this and have issues, just uninstall and reinstall from Nook Store/Cloud vs. Google Play Store and you'll be fine.)All of the other Android apps from Google Play that I tried have worked fine.  Pandora, Stitcher Internet Radio, Maps, Amazon MP3, Amazon Kindle (wow! a bit of a surprise!), Gmail, YouTube, etc. all work as expected.  The new openness of the NOOK HD+ is a game changer for the NOOK line, and pushes it way up in the rankings in my opinion.I bought mine at the local B&N; store and there's a lot of help available there if you need it, which is a huge bonus if you are tech challenged and need advice and help locally.  Very friendly staff and great customer service, what a novel concept!  ;)The Nook HD+ is a ""sleeper"" - an often overlooked alternative to other more expensive tablets that can both out perform them and well beat them in value, being available currently at very attractive prices.

I realize for those that have come from old hardware or new to tablets might believe this is a bit harsh, but keep in mind this is more of a comparison to other options available out there. Granted there are price differences and for price alone, this is a decent deal.The hardware itself is impressive. Bought these for our 4 and 6 years which were upgrading from their Galaxy 2 7"" tablets.

It is very clunky and very slow, not at all snappy by any sense, even with the latest updates. I did buy it as they finally put Play on it which was a requirement for me, but the OS itself is just horrible. It does have a kids profile mods which is very handy as it allows you to limit what your kids can open.Additionally, as this is an 'overlay' OS, it is very limited in terms of options. Sound options are none existent for various task such as switching profiles, etc. Many apps on the Google store will indicate not compatible with this device. I generally ROM my Android devices however CM10 is the only one at this time with any support and that ROM is very very buggy compared to say Frosty ROM which is not available for this tablet. It works, but again, not a smooth integration of a ROM. So really, your stuck with what B&N; puts on it and at this time, it is very slow and clunky. Now you can 'BUY' a card with Jelly Bean on it, but again, pulling off the card is slower vs. internal memory, though it does allow for a very simple method of getting a 'real' Android OS on this tablet and perhaps the best route at this time.For the kids, they still like the tablet, enjoy the better graphics, larger screen, etc. Once going graphics is good, sound is adequate though not great, touch input is good. But for me, I could never use this tablet for serious use. My Asus TF700T is my go to tablet, even over my iPad 4,3,2,etc. At this time I am contemplating just selling these and buy Nexus tablets for the kids instead as it is more a pure Android experience and not hindered by the clunky implementation of an older Android OS. Perhaps if B&N; releases an OS based on Jelly Bean it may improve things.Bottom line, there are far better options in the Android world.PROSGood resolutionTouch is goodGreat balance of size, not large nor small like a 7"" tabletHas Play installedExternal memory card optionCONSB&N; OS is horrible, slow, cluncky, and based on old Ice Cream Sandwich, not Jelly BeanSpeakers are just OKVery limited accessory options compared to even Kindle HD devicesCharger plug is very tight on both of my models. Perhaps it will loosen up over time.

672,6301977173,"[15, 26]",2.0,"This film is definitely not for anyone who is especially fond of the independent, delightfully manipulative and clever boy who was the brain child of Samuel Clemens's classic.As one example, the book has great  fun with the scenes involving Aunt Polly, a simple minded soul who thinks  herself quite clever, and the genuinely shrewd Tom, who plays on catering  to Polly's illusions about her own wit. This is a far cry from beautiful,  intelligent Celeste Holm's portrayal of Polly - and the family's poverty,  clearly seen in the book, disappears, as the Sawyers occupy a beautiful  home and are close friends with wealthy Widow Douglas.Some of the plot  is distorted in ways that remove the charm of the original. Tom's taking  off to &quot;play pirates&quot; after Becky jilts him is changed into a  troubled kid's escape after Aunt Polly tells him how &quot;no good&quot;  his father was - the humour, and the engaging portrayal of adolescent  &quot;first love&quot; is gone. The theme of Tom's learning responsibility  is overworked, and sequences that are hilarious in the book (Sunday school,  classroom, etc) are largely left out. The enchanting Becky Thatcher is  reduced to a tomboy. And isn't much of the picnic sequence ruined when a  gathering of kids is changed to a song-and-dance outing for families? (Tom  Sawyer is quite realistic in its setting forth that kids are far more  concerned with themselves than fretting about parents - let's not turn it  into a commentary on &quot;family values&quot; a la 1990s political  correctness.)Johnny Whitaker's singing voice has all the appeal of  chalk squeaking on a blackboard.

673,6301977173,"[1, 1]",4.0,"I hadn't heard of this 1973 movie version of the classic Mark Twain story until recently, but I absolutely had to see it.  After all, it had music by the Sherman Brothers (best known for their work in Mary Poppins).  And I love a good musical.The book stays very true to the novel.  Tom Sawyer (Johnny Whitaker) is a young boy growing up in 1840's Hannibal, Missouri.  An orphan, he's being raised by his Aunt Polly (Celeste Holm).  And he is quite the handful.  He regularly plays hooky to fish and swim with best pal Huckleberry Finn (Jeff East).  He constantly lies to get out of trouble, too.Through this movie, we watch as Tom struggles with his conscience after witnessing a murder in the cemetery.  He tricks the boys in town to white washing the fence for him.  And he develops a crush on new girl Becky Thatcher (a young Jodie Foster).  But will Injun Joe (Kunu Hank) get his sworn revenge on the boy?This movie is extremely faithful to the book, hitting all the highlights of the classic.  Frankly, that was a problem for me since it took a little while to get going.  Once I got into the story, I was hooked and really began to enjoy the tale.  The scenery and costumes recreate the times well.  And the acting was pretty good.Unfortunately, I found the songs disappointing.  They weren't bad, but they weren't good either.  They aren't especially memorable or singable, and they don't really advance the story.  I would rather rewatch this movie for the characters and adventures then the songs.Despite that rather major flaw for a musical, I must admit to enjoying it.  It has a sweetness and innocence that I enjoyed.  And the songs are easy to overlook since they aren't a major part of the movie.

703,8862935293,"[3, 3]",2.0,"I've used this cover with both a Kindle (Generation 2) and a Nook. Surprisingly, this case is better designed for a Nook for two reasons:>>The sleep/power button location. On the Nook, the button is on the top center so none of the four corner holds block any button or access port. However, on the Kindle the button - which requires a slide, not a press - is towards the left of the device top and is covered slightly by the top left corner hold. This isn't a deal breaker for me, but I was very surprised at it because its being marketed for the Kindle! So when I want to wake up my Kindle I have to move the corner hold, slide the switch, and then readjust the corner hold. Not easy to do because the hold has a lot of (good) tension.>>5 way directional key. The notebooks that are included with this case slide into the case from the top and still have room to move both left and right. Because of the lining of the case and the thin cover of the notebook, it slides easily but I've never had it come out. I have however had it slide far right inside the cover, and then when I shut the cover it's at such a position that it hits the 5 way directional key and starts to advance chapters! I thought it was just a fluke at first, but then it kept happening. If I do not adjust the position of the notebook or force the Kindle into sleep then the notebook hits the key every time now.

The only thing missing is a pen loop.Other vitals you may want to know:-- It's 1.375 inches in thickness with iPad loaded (that's almost an inch and a half)-- The cover doesn't appear to be leather, even though it appears to be leather.  Just like the notebooks.-- Interior is microsuede-- IPad is very secure in there.-- Spine is rounded, not square-- You can fold back the entire thing so it's flat.-- Not able to prop this thing up to view from afar (too slippery), and no prop is included.-- All buttons, ports, and speakers are accessible.-- Looks good, feels good.All that said, Moleskine made a mistake with their design.

710,8862936826,"[49, 53]",2.0,"I'm starting my review over and changing this from 4 stars (I like it) to 2 stars (I don't like it).. At first I praised it highly based upon initial expectations., but now that I actually used it for work I'm seeing it may not be the case for me.I've tried a number of cases for the ipad from a travel case to the marware eco-vue to the otterbox. I always wanted one with a notepad built in and was excited to see the Moleskine iPad case. I placed my order on Nov. 7th and after nearly 3 weeks it finally arrived.Initial reactions, I like the case. It was thick and felt pretty solid. I liked the way the case held the iPad and overall the case seemed really well built. Now, I don't have ANY issues with the build quality. The case is built very well. And others have complained about the thickness, well I expected it to be a little thick since it now has a notebook with it. My measurement, it's just at the 1"" mark in terms of thickness.What did I like:-Construction quality, very nicely made.-iPad protection, the iPad is held very securely in the case, big plus.-Love that it has a notebook, unfortunately it's not a standard size which makes this a minus as well.-Looks professional. This is one of the best looking cases I have seen.My issue comes into the issues I found while using the case.First off, the volume and mute switch are on the inside of the case. This means you need to fold open the case if you need to mute or turn the sound down on your ipad. It's a minor inconvenience, but if I'm in a meeting and my calendar app starts shooting alerts it's nice to be able to flip the switch quickly then go through opening the notebook up and having to mute it. Now in most meetings I am actively taking notes but in other meetings I'm just a observer so when I am not taking notes this issue causes more of a distraction.Second, replacement notebooks. I have been searching high and low for replacement notebooks and cannot find any. I found some small jr. legal pads and tried those and yes they work, but they don't sit as securely in the sleeve like the moleskine brand pad is and I think this could cause to ripping or sagging of the fabric. I think you are going to need moleskine brand pads or risk ruining the fabric sleeve. This is just a guess. And since you can't at the current time buy replacement notebooks you are out of luck once you run through the initial 50 pages.Third, no pen loop. They give you a notebook and a spot for your iPad, but nowhere to hook a pen. Yes I can carry a pen in my pocket, but you would think for the cost there would be a small loop to hold a pen or iPad Stylus like the pogosketch.Fourth, the true left-handedness of the case. The case can in fact be used by left handed people, but that causes a few issues. First off the back becomes the cover and now you have an upside down moleskine logo, plus the band is attached to the back so the sleek look is gone. Then my biggest complaint, the iPad is upside down when used in left handed mode so the home button is at the top. This also means the microphone is opposite the home button. So when the home button is at the top the microphone is pointed towards you. I use an app to record audio from meetings and take notes and when the iPad is faced the right direction this works flawlessly. When I use the Moleskine case in left handed mode the microphone faces me and in turn the audio is hard to hear as it is pointed away from the conversations.Fifth, no stand. It would be nice if you could somehow stand the ipad up but this case is really just meant to be used flat on it's back. It's not sold as a case with a stand, but come on, for topping the $60 mark you would think it would have one.All in all, it's  nice to finally have a case, built well with a notepad. But given the lack of replacement notebooks readily for sale for this case and no pen loop to carry a writing instrument makes it weak. I can use the case in right handed mode, but they sell it as left handed compatible and it really isn't as functional as it should be. They instead should release a second model that IS built for left handed and not make one unit semi-reversible.I may end up returning this case and going back to my marware. I'm going to keep using it until the end of this week before deciding..--UPDATE 12/9/2010--I have returned the case back to Amazon and have gone back to theMarware Eco-Vue for iPad. This out of all the cases I have use is the best for my personal situation. I wanted to like the Moleskine case but it just didn't work for me and I still can't find replacement notepads.

Now you can have a 4k monitor but if your graphics card is kicking at 1000 fps, your monitor will only support 30 fps of it (its a dumbed down version of it but hz matter, and you want at least 60, if not more3) 4k monitors may require more than 1 connection (aka 2 dvi port connections) to run well.4) 4k is still reaaaaly new.

It still has a lot going for it; it's sleek, compact, and attractive, it's got Bluetooth and WiFi, and a 624 Mhz processor (the fastest processor available then). But I can't imagine why anyone would want to buy this outdated model, especially since the price listed here for a brand new unit is higher than what it retailed for in 2004. It uses Windows Mobile 2003 (WM v4), which isn't supported by MS anymore. The current version of Windows Mobile is 6.1.Additionally, Dell has discontinued the Axim X30 since 2007. You will have trouble getting support from Dell if you run into any problems.But complaints about it being outdated aside, the Dell Axim X30 has a few significant problems with it:1) A problem commonly reported is the backup battery going bad or burning out. There is no way to replace it unless you want to venture into cracking the case open and soldering the right kind of battery on.2) A lot of users, like myself, have the problem with the built-in storage spontaneously disappearing. The PPC doesn't ""see"" the drive anymore; it's like it doesn't even exist.3) Activesync frequently fails to sync some task and calendar items.4) Pathetic battery life.

764,9573212919,"[11, 13]",5.0,"I purchased this player for my 9 year old daughters Acer Aspire One Netbook D255E for her to play DVDs, games and to load Norton 360 on the netbook.  Item arrived quickly in a box combined with other items from Amazon, simply wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap and put in the box.  There were no receipts etc for the shipment, and only a small booklet for installation on older Windows OS systems.  The booklet DID mention that the unit is a CD/DVD burner, but required additional software to do so (I checked on my Acer 5532 laptop after plugging it in and running a diagnostic check, it is only a DVD/CD player).  It also came with a USB driver disc which was unnecessary for my installation, and two USB plugs, one for media and one for power.  Simple to figure out though, just plug in both USB plugs and Windows 7 Starter did the rest.  However, like others with Windows 7 Starter, I had to download VLC Media Player to play DVD's.  No problem there, except for the additional junk that came with the Media player download which I immediately deleted. The CD/DVD player works great now, and sounds especially awesome on earbuds.  I have a Windows anytime upgrade from Starter to full home version ready to install, but I may return it now that I have this DVD/CD Rom working and the free desktop download correction fixed.Cons:  I was let down that so many others purchased the same unit and received a free upgrade to a DVD/CD burner.  That is not a real major setback since this is for a 9 yr olds netbook, but it would have been nice to have as a back up to our other burner.  One for all and all for one I say!Pros:  Easy,  I mean EASY setup.  Also found it nice that you do not need to utilize both USB cables, just plug in the media plug to the USB 2 and that is all required.  Great price considering the seller guaranteed it would work with my Acer One Netbook model.  Free shipping!!!!  Case seems to be sturdy enough, (just don't pick it up and turn it side to side while it is playing).  Region settings available, so it plays most everything.  GREAT DVD picture on both my Acer laptop and the Acer Aspire one netbook, very pleased!Overall,  I would recommend this to anyone needing a DVD/CD rom for the Acer Aspire One Netbook,  provided you do not want a unit for burning CD's and DVD's..UPDATE 01 March 2011:  The more I use this player the more I like it.  The picture on my daughters Acer Aspire one Netbook is sharper than the one on my Acer Laptop with widescreen HD. If you are an Acer Netbook lover, this is the external player for you.  Just a reminder, it is not a DVD/CD burner.Final Update 04-14-2011:  I finally upgraded my daughters Acer One Netbook from Windows starter to Windows 7 and the new OS picked up this player with no external help required for drivers etc.  I also upgraded to 2GB memory, (see my other reviews), which took all of about 4 minutes to accomplish!  My daughter is playing video games and watching DVD movies off this little player like there is no tomorrow!!  I am amazed that this player has performed as it has.

785,9575871979,"[67, 70]",4.0,"I've had this kit for a few months now and have recharged a pair of the batteries 3 times, and a third battery once. So far everything works as expected. I use them in a Fenix P3D Premium 100 (Luxeon Rebel LED, 11 - 200 lumens), and a Fenix P1 CE (Cree 7090 XR-E LED - 90 lumens). For me the performance is very acceptable considering how inexpensive the kit was. I get maybe an hour to 1-1/2 hours total runtime depending which brightness levels I'm using. I don't use the lights for more than 10 or 15 minutes at a time anyway so that's plenty of uses between charges for me.A nice plus is you get the car charger adapter included, too. Most kits require you to buy that separately at additional cost. Probably the only thing I would have liked with the kit is some kind of pouch to keep it all together. I made a carrying case out of an old zippered memory card/battery case I had hanging around. It just happens to all fit perfectly but it took an awful lot of finagling to make that happen!UPDATE 11-14-09I just wanted to update this review to say I am still using these cells and they are still working great. I think the runtime has improved after a few charge/recharge cycles (which is what is supposed to happen), so these are lasting even longer in my lights now. I only recharge them maybe every 4 months with occasional use of my lights. Still highly recommended.UPDATE 11-17-2010I guess it's time for my now yearly update on these batteries. They are still all going strong! I still only recharge them about every 4 months but that's because they have a very good charge retention and capacity.Another big surprise involving these batteries occurred over the summer (2010). I keep my Fenix P1 CE light on my keychain. To turn the light on and off you screw and unscrew the head slightly. If you unscrew it all the way the head comes off (that how you replace the battery). I guess the head had loosened in my pocket because one day as I was walking to my car I removed my car keys from my pocket. I stepped on something hard and happened to look down to see what it was. Well, it turned out to be one of these batteries! I had slightly deformed the top of the battery and ripped part of the plastic that makes up the case of the battery.

Stayed in over 22 hotels and on a train sleeper car and never had a problem.  I travel with a CPAP breathing machine and it was critical to have power every night so I could sleep.  I also had an iPhone and my brother had an iPad and the USB charger was great for both.  I could also use one plug to both power the CPAP and charge the iPhone.  It was really nice to have the red lights that indicated that you had power since many outlets in Europe and UK have some sort of switch that turns the power off to each individual outlet.  Also, on the train, the red light wast coming on and let me know that the outlet wasn't working.  I worked with the conductor to get some circuit breakers on the train reset by letting him know when the red light came back on.  That was quite a time saver and great tool for that purpose.The only negative I have is that the part that holds the US plug into the device could be a little more snug.  It felt like it was going to fall out at times (and did fallout 1-2 times but that wasn't much over 6 weeks of use).There is one design enhancement that I would have put into this device: When using the UK converter, they could have made the bottom of the device a 2nd 110 outlet so that you would have 2 110 outlets (the regular one on the back and one on the bottom using the Euro converter) as well as the USB outlet.

I have removed the fuse and ordered replacements. When I get it working again, I'll post an update. It is marked as a 3 A, 250 V fast blowing fuse, which means that this is rated for about 750 W. That's about half the wattage of a typical hairdryer, so hairdryers on one of these are pretty much out of the question, but it's more than enough power for charging any kind of electronics that a traveler would carry.The red indicator LEDs are helpful to know that it's working, but they are fairly bright, so if bright LEDs in a small hotel room are a distraction from sleeping, plan ahead to cover them up with something.Update: I replaced the blown fuse with one of these:QUALITY USA brand fuses!! Set of 5 pieces, 3AG3A250V, F3AL250V, F3A 250V, F3 L250V, F3A 250V, F3L250V cartridge GLASS fuses 6X30mm (1/4 in x 1-1/4 in) , 3A 250V, Fast-blow (Fast Acting).
